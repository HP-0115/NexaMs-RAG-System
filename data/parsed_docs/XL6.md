## SeatBelt Force Limiter System (Only for Front Seat)

72SM01015

<!-- image -->

In the event of a strong impact coming from the front, the seat belt force limiter operates in twostages toreducea force to the shoulder strap, thus lessening the impact being sustained by the front passengers.

72SM01025

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

If the seat belt sustains strong impact, the resin of the shoulder anchorpart(1)and the tongueplate part (2) couid soften due to heavy friction, thus sticking to the seat belt, making the belt slide less easily. In such a case, the seat belt may not provide the best performance, resulting in severe injury in case of emergency. Have the seat belt replaced by a Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

## WARNING

An airbag supplements or adds to the collisionprotectionofferedbyseat belts. The driver and all passengers must be properly restrained by fasteningseatbeltsatalltimes,whether ornotanairbagismountedattheir seating position, to minimize the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a collision.

## AIRBAG light

63J030

If the "AIRBAG" light on the instrument clusterdoesnotblinkorcomeonwhenthe ignition mode is first changed to "ON", or the "AIRBAG" light stays on, or comes on while driving, the airbag system (or the seat belt pretensioner system) may not work properly.Have the airbagsystem inspected by aMaruti Suzuki authorised workshop as soon as possible.

## Front Airbags

<!-- image -->

63J259

Front airbag is designed to inflate in severe frontal collisions when the ignition mode is "ON".

NOTE: In a frontal angle collision, the side airbags may inflate

Front airbag is not designed to inflate in rear impacts, side impacts, rollovers or minor frontal collisions, since they would offer no protection in those types of accidents. Remember, since an airbag deploys only one time during an accident, seat belts are needed to restrain occupants from further movements during the accident.

Therefore, an airbag is not a substitute for seat belts. To maximize your protection, always fasten your seat belts. Be aware that no system can prevent all possible injuries that may occur in an accident.

## How theSystemWorks

In a frontal collision, the collision sensors willdetectrapiddeceleration,andifthe controller judges that the deceleration represents a severe frontal collision, the controller will trigger the inflators. If your vehicle is equipped with side airbags and side curtain airbags, crash sensors will detect a side collision, and if the controller judges that the side collision is severe enough, it will trigger the side airbag inflators. The inflators inflate the appropriate airbags with nitrogen or argon gas. The inflated airbags provide a cushion for your head(front airbags and side curtain airbeqie au1 Xpoq jaddn pue (Kjuo sbeq inflatesanddeflatessoquicklythatyou maynot evenrealizethat it has activated. The airbag will neither hinder your view nor makeit hardertoexit thevehicle.

Airbags must inflate quickly and forcefully inordertoreducethechanceofseriousor fatal injuries. However, an unavoidable consequence of the quick inflation is that the airbag may irritate bare skin, such as the facial area against a front airbag. Wash off anyresidue assoon aspossible toprevent skin irritation. Also, upon inflation, a loudnoisewilloccurandsomepowder and smoke will be released.These conditions arenotharmful anddonot indicatea fire inthevehicle.Beaware,however,that some airbag components may be hot for a while after inflation.

A seat belt helps keep you in the proper position for maximum protection when an airbag inflates. Adjust your seat as far back as possible while still maintaining control of the vehicle. Sit fully back in your seat;situpstraight;donotleanover the steeringwheelordashboard.Frontoccupants should not lean on or sleep against the door. Refer to the "Seat Adjustment" section and the "Seat Belts and Child RestraintSystems"inthis sectionfor details on proper seat and seat belt adjustments.

## NOTE:

Itisnormalforwatertodripfromtheair conditioning systemwhile and after use.

- 4) Make sure the hood is fully closed and latched.
2. 5）Check the headlights, turn signal lights, brake lights and horn for proper operation.
- 6) Adjust the seat and head restraint.
- 7) Check the brake pedal and the parking brakelever.Checkthebrakepedal feeling and the adjustment condition for theparkingbrakeleverorpedal.Refer to"Brakes"in"INSPECTIONAND MAINTENANCE"sectionfordetails.
5. 8）Adjust the mirrors.
6. 10)Make sure that all warning lights come on as the ignition is pushed to "ON".
- 9) Make sure that you and all passengers have properly fastened the seat belts.
8. 11)Check all gauges.
9. 12)MakesurethattheBRAKESYSTEM WARNING light turns off when the parking brake is released.

Once a week, or each time you fill your fuel tank, or before a long distance driving (like highway driving) perform  the following under-hood checks:

- 1） Engine oil level
- Coolant level
- 3) Brake fluid level
- 4） Battery fluid (acid) level
- 5）Windshieldwasherfluidlevel
- 6）Hoodlatchoperation

Pull thehoodreleasehandleinsidethe vehicle.Makesurethatyoucannot openthehoodallthewaywithout releasing the secondary latch. Be sure to close the hood securely after checking for proper latch operation. See the item "All latches, hinges and locks" of "CHASSIS ANDBODY"in"Periodic Maintenance Schedule"in"INSPECTIONANDMAINTENANCE"sectionfor lubrication schedule.

## WARNING

Make sure the hood is fully closed and latched before driving. If it is not, it can fly up unexpectedly during driving, obstructing your view and resulting in an accident.

Onceamonth,oreachtimeyou fillyour fuel tank or before a long distance driving (like highway driving), check the tyre pressure using a tyre pressure gauge. Also check the tyre pressure of the spare tyre.

## Engine Oil Consumption

It is normal for the engine to consume some engine oil during normal vehicle operation.

More oil is consumed during high-speed driving and when there is frequent accelerationanddeceleration.Underhighloads, yourenginealsowill consumemoreoil.

The amount of engine oil consumption dependsonviscosityandqualityoftheoil andyourdrivingconditions.

A new engine also consumes more oil, since its pistons, piston rings and cylinder walls have not yet become conditioned. New engines reach the normal level of oil consumptiononlyafter approximately 5000 km driving.

## Oil consumption: Max.1.0 Lper 1000km

When judging the amount of oil consumption, note that the oil may become diluted and it is difficult to judge the accurate oil level.

Asanexample,if avehicle isused for repeated short trips, and consumes a normal amount of oil，the dipstick may not show any drop in the oil level at all, even after 10o0 km or more of driving.This is because the oil is gradually becoming diluted with fuel or moisture，making it appear that the oil level has not changed. You should also be aware that the diluting ingredients evaporate out when the vehicle is subsequently driven at high speeds, such as on an expressway, making it appear that oil is excessively consumed after high-speed driving.

## Page 138
## NOTICE

Donotdownshift to alower gear at the speed faster than the maximum allowable speeds for the next lower speed, or severe damage to engine and transmission can result.

## WARNING

- Reduce your speed and downshift to a lower gear before going down a long\_ or steep hill. A lower gear will allow the engine to provide braking. Avoid riding the brakes or they may overheat, resulting in brake failure.
- When driving on slippery roads, slow downbefore downshifting. Excessive and/or sudden changes in engine speed may cause loss of traction,which could causeyou to lose control.

## NOTICE

Before engaging reverse gear [R], checkthatthevehicleiscompletely stationary and gear lever is in neutral [N] position. After depressing clutch pedal fully, shift to [R].

72R0074

When the gearshift lever is in a position other than "N" (Neutral), the gearshift indicator is indicatedon the information display when the ignition mode is "ON".

For vehicles equipped with the cruise control when the system is not in use.

The electronic controlsystemmonitors driving condition (such as vehicle speed and/or engine revolution), and it shows which gear position is optimal for your driving with the indication on the display.

If UP/DOWNarrowisindicatedonthedisplay while driving, we recommend you to shift up or down the gear until the arrow disappears. It is the optimal gear position for a driving condition that reduces the over revolution and stress to the engine, and improves fuel consumption.

For details onhow to use thetransmission, refer to "Using the Transmission" in this section.

## Cruise Control

The cruise control system allows you to maintain a steady speed without keeping your foot on the accelerator pedal. The controls for operating the cruise control system are on the steering wheel.

You can use the cruise control system under thefollowingconditions:

- ·For manualtransmission vehicle,the gear position is in 3rd, 4th or 5th.
- For automatic transmissionvehicle,the gearshift lever is in "D" position or the gear position is in 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th in manual mode.
- The vehicle speed is about 40 km/h or higher.

## WARNING

To help avoid loss of vehicle control, do not use the cruise control system when driving in heavy traffic, on slippery or winding roads, or on steep downhills.

## Parking Sensors

The parking sensor system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles near the rear bumper. If obstacles are sensed while you are parking or moving the vehicle slowly, the system warns you by sounding a buzzer and displaying symbols representingtheobstaclesontheinformationdisplayintheinstrumentcluster.

- ·The system emits an ultrasonic wave andtherelevantsensordetectsthe returnof thewavereflectedbyanobstacle. The system measures the time takenbytheultrasonicwavetoreachthe obstacleandreturnfrom it,fromwhich it determinestheobstacle'sposition.
- The parking sensor function can be used when the ignition mode to "ON",the gearshift lever is in R position. This function is helpful in the following cases: pulling over to the curb; parallel-parking the vehicle;steeringthevehicleintoa garage; driving along an alley; and moving slowly in a place with obstacles.

## WARNING

- The parking sensor warns you of obstacles withbuzzers andby showing you thelocation of the obstaclesontheinformationdisplay. However, you must still pay full attention yourself while driving.
- Thesensors candetectobstacles only within a limited area andonly when the vehicle is moving within a limited speed range. So, in tricky areas,you must move the vehicle slowly while checking aroundit using your direct vision or rearview mirrors.There is increased risk of an accident ifyou control thevehicle relying only on the parking sensor.

## Sensor Locations

## NOTICE

- Avoid hitting the sensor areas or directing the nozzle of a high-pressurecarwasherontothesensor areas. Otherwise, the sensors may be damaged.
- If thebumper hits ahard object,the sensors on it may not work properly. If this occurs, have the sensors inspected by a Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

## Braking

60G165A

<!-- image -->

The distance needed to bring any vehicle to a halt increases with the speed of the vehicle. The braking distance needed, for example,at 60 km/h will be approximately 4 times greater than the braking distance neededat 30km/h.Starttodepress the brake pedal when there is plenty of distance between your vehicle and the stopping point, and slow down gradually.

## WARNING

If water gets into the brake devices, brake performance may become poor and unpredictable. After driving through water or washing the underside of the vehicle,test thebrakes while driving at a slow speed to see if they have maintained their normal effectiveness.Ifthebrakesareless effective than normal, dry them by repeatedly applying the brakes while driving slowly until the brakes have regained their normal effectiveness.

## NOTE:

Whilebrakingyou mayhear operational noiseduetofrictionbetweenbrakedisc/ drum and brake lining. This is a normal phenomenonanddoesnotindicateany abnormality oraffectnormal functioningof thevehicle.

## Power-Assisted Brakes

Your vehicle has power-assisted brakes. If power assistance is lost due to a stalled engine or other failures, the system is still fully operational on reserve power and you can bring the vehicle to a complete stop by pressing the brake pedal once and holding it down. The reserve power is partly used up when you depress the brake pedal and reduceseachtime thepedalis pressed. Apply smooth and even pressure to the pedal. Do not pump the pedal.

## WARNING

Even without reserve power in the brake system, you can still stop the vehicle by pressing the brake pedal harder than normally required. However, the stopping distance may be longer.

## Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS)

ABS will help you avoid skidding by electronically controlling braking pressure. It will also help you maintain steering control when braking on slippery surfaces or when braking hard.

The ABS works automatically, so you do not need any special braking technique. Just push the brake pedal down without pumping. The ABS will operate whenever it senses that the wheels are locking up. You may feel the brake pedal moves a little while the ABS is operating.

## NOTE:

- ·TheABSwill not work ifvehiclespeed is underabout9km/h.
- IftheABSsystemisactivated,youmay hear a clunking noise and/or feelpulsatinginthebrakepedal.Thisisnormal and indicatesthatthebrakefluidpressure is being controlled properly.
- You may hear an operationsound when youstarttheengineorafterthevehicle beginstomove.Thismeansthatthe abovesystemsareintheself-check mode.Thissounddoesnotindicatea malfunction.

## WARNING

- On some types of loose surfaces (such as  gravel, snow-covered roads,etc.),the stopping distance required for avehiclewithABS may be slightly greater than the onerequiredfor acomparablevehicle with a conventional brake system. With a conventional brake system, skidding tyres are able to plow the gravel or snow layer, shortening the stopping distance. ABSminimizesthisresistance effect. Allow for extra stopping distance whendriving onloose surfaces.
- On regular paved roads, some drivers may be able to obtain slightly shorter stopping distances with conventionalbrake systems than withABS.
- ·Inbothoftheaboveconditions, ABSwillstilloffertheadvantageof helping you maintain directional control. However, remember that ABS will not compensate for bad road or weather conditions or poor driver judgment. Use good judgment anddonotdrive toofast.

## Page 172
## WARNING

- If the ABS warning light(1)on the instrumentpanelcomesonand stays on while driving, there may be a problem with the ABS system. Ask a Maruti Suzuki authorised workshoptoinspect theABSsys tem immediately. If the ABS system becomesinoperative,thebrake system will function as an ordinary brake system that has no ABS.
- If the ABS warning light (1) and the Brake system warning light (2) on theinstrumentpanelsimultaneously stays on or comes on while driving, both anti-lock function and rearbrake force controlfunction (proportioning valve function)of theABSsystemmayhavefailed. If so, the rear wheels may easily skid orthevehiclecanevenspininthe worst case when braking on a slippery road or when hard braking evenonadrypavedroad.Ask a Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop to inspect the ABS system immediately. Drive carefully, avoiding hard braking as much as possible.

## HowtheABSWorks

Acomputercontinuouslymonitorswheel speed. The computer compares the changes in wheel speed when braking. If the wheels slow suddenly,indicating a skidding situation, the computer will change braking pressure several times each second to prevent the wheels from locking. When you start your vehicle or when you accelerate after a hard stop, you may hear a momentary motor or clicking noise as the system resets or checks itself. "This is absolutely normal and indicate that ABS is functioning properly".

## WARNING

The ABS may not work properly if tyres or wheels other than those specified in the owner's manual are used.ThisisbecausetheABSworks by comparing changes in wheel speed. When replacing tyres or wheels, use only the size and type specified in this owner's manual.

## Electronic stability program (ESP?)

ESP? is a registered trademark of Daimler AG.

The Electronic Stability Program (ESP?) helps to control the vehicle during cornering if front wheels or rear wheels skid. It also assists you in maintaining traction while accelerating on loose or slippery road surfaces.It does this by regulating the engine's output, and by selectively applying the brakes. In addition, ESP? helps to avoid skidding by controlling braking pressure.

## WARNING

The Esp cannot enhance the vehicle'sdrivingstabilityinallsituations and does not control your vehicle's entire braking system. The Esp? cannot prevent accidents, including thoseresultingfromexcessivespeed in turns, or hydroplaning. Only safe and attentive drive can prevent accidents. The capabilities of an ESP? equipped vehicle must never be used as a substitute for careful driving.

The ESP? totally manages following four systems, (stability control, traction control, ABSandBrakeassist)tohelpenhance vehicle stability in response to various driving conditions;

## Page 173
## Stability control system

Thevehiclestabilitycontrolsystemhelps provide integrated control of systems such as anti-lock brakes, traction control, engine control，etc.This systemautomatically controls the brakes and engine to help prevent the vehicle from skidding when cornering on a slippery road surface or when turning the steering wheel abruptly.

## Traction control system

Thetractioncontrolsystemautomatically helps prevent the spinning of wheels when thevehicleisstartedoracceleratedon slippery road surfaces. The system operates only if it senses that some of the wheels are spinning or beginning to lose traction.Whenthishappens,the system operates the front or rear brakes and reduces engine power to limit wheel spin.

## NOTE:

You may hear an operation sound when youstarttheengineorafterthevehicle beginstomove.Thismeansthatthe abovesystemsareintheself-checkmode. Thissounddoesnotindicateamalfunction.

## Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS)

ABS will help you avoid skidding by electronically controlling braking pressure. It will also help you maintain steering control when braking on slippery surfaces or when brakinghard.The ABS works automatically, so you do not have to use any special braking technique. Just push the brake pedal down without pumping. The ABS will operate whenever it senses that wheels are locking up. You may feel the brake pedal pulsate while the ABS is operating. (For more information on ABS, see "Braking" in this section.)

## NOTE:

- ·TheABSwill not work if vehiclespeed is underabout9km/h.
- ·If the ABS system is activated, you may hearaclunkingnoiseand/orfeelpulsatand indicates that the brake fluid pressure is being controlled properly.

## Brake assist system

When you step on the brake pedal, the brakeassistsystemdeterminesittobean emergency stop and provides more powerful braking for a driver who cannot hold down the brake pedal firmly.

## NOTE:

Ifyouquicklyandforcefullydepressthe brakes,you may hear a clicking sound in the brake pedal. This is normal and indi- cates that the brake assist system is activated properly.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- The Esp? may not work properly if tyres or wheels other than those specified in the owner's manual are used. when replacing tyres or wheels, use only the size and type specified in this owner's manual.
- TheESP? may not work properly if tyres are fitted with tyre chains.
- The Esp may not work properly if tyres are not inflated to the recommended tyre pressure.
- The Esp? may not work properly if the tyres areexcessivelyworn. Replace tyres when the tread wear indicators in the grooves appear on the tread surface.
- The ESp? is not a substitute for winter tyres or tyre chains on a snow-coveredroad.

## Tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS) (if equipped)

The tyre pressure monitoring system is designed to alert you when one or more of the tyres on your vehicle is significantly under-inflated. The tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensor containing a uniqueidentificationcodeismountedon eachwheel.TheTPMSsensorstransmit tyre pressure signals to the receiver of the tyre pressure monitoring system controller. When the inflation pressure of one or more tyres indicates significant under-inflation, the low tyre pressure warning light shown belowcomeson.

## Low tyre pressure warning light

<!-- image -->

72SM03028

Each tyre should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to theinflationpressurerecommendedbythevehiclemanufacturer on the vehicle placard or tyre inflation pressure label. (lf your vehicle has tyres of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tyre inflation pressure label, you should determine the proper tyre inflation pressure for those tyres.)

As an added fuel efficiency feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tyre pressure warning light when one or more of your tyres is significantlyunder-inflated.

Accordingly, when the low tyre pressure warning light illuminates, you should stop and checkyour tyres assoonaspossible, and inflate them to the proper pressure.

Drivingonasignificantlyunder-inflated tyrecausesthetyretooverheatandcan leadtotyre failure.Under-inflationalso reduces fuel efficiency and tyre tread life, andmayaffectthevehicle'shandlingand stopping ability.

## OPERATINGYOURVEHICLE

Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tyre maintenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tyre pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tyre pressure warning light.

## AWARNING

Relying only onthe tyre pressure monitoringsystemtodetermine when it is necessary to add air to the tyres can result in loss of control or an accident.

Check tyre inflation pressures monthlywhenthetyresarecold.If necessary, adjust them to the recommended inflation pressure as specifiedon thevehicle'styreinformation placard and in this owner's manual. ANDMAINTENANCE"seCtion.

The low tyre pressure warning light can comeonduetonormalcauses suchas natural air leakage and pressure changes caused by changes in temperature or atmospheric pressure.Adjustingtheair shownonthetyreinformationplacard should cause the low tyre pressure warning light to turn off.

To make the low tyre pressure warning light go off, adjust the tyre pressures when the tyres are cold, and drive the vehicle for about 10 minutes.

When the adjusted tyre pressure is recognized, the low tyre pressure warning light willgo off and the information display showsthecurrenttyre pressure(ifyou select the TPMS monitor (if equipped)).

## NOTICE

If the low tyre pressure warning light does not go off even when you drive formorethan10minutesafteradjusting the cold tyre pressure, there may be a problem with the TPMS. Have yourvehicleinspectedbyaMARUTI SUZUKl authorised workshop.

- If the light turns on again shortly after adjusting the pressure in your tyres, you may have a flat tyre. If you have a flat tyre,replace it with the spare tyre(if s    b tions"in"EMERGENCYSERVICE"seCtion.Also refer to "Replacing tyre and/ or wheels" for instructions on how to restore normaloperationof theTyre pressure monitoring system after you have a flat tyre.

## TPMS Malfunction Indicator

Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunctionindicator toindicate when the system is not operating properly.

The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tyre pressure warning light.Whenthesystemdetectsamalfunction, the low pressure warning light will flashforabout75secondsandthen remain continuously illuminated. This vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists.

The TPMSmalfunctionindicatoris not reset even after the engine is turned off; it remains in the on state until the normal conditionsarerestored.

Whenthe malfunctionindicator isilluminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tyre pressure as intended.TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons,including the installationofreplacementoralternate tyresorwheelsonthevehiclethatprevent the TPMS from functioning properly. Always check the low pressure warning light after replacing one or more tyres or wheelsonyourvehicletoensurethatthe replacementoralternatetyresandwheels allow the TPMS to continue to function properly.

## WARNING

- FastenYourSeatBeltsatAll Times. Eventhoughairbagsareequipped at the front seating positions, the driver and all passengers should be properly restrained at all times, using the seat belts provided.Refer to"Seat Belts and Child Restraint Systems"section for instructions on proper use of the seat belts.
- Never drivewhileunder theinfluence of alcohol or other drugs. Alcohol and drugs can seriously impair your ability to drive safely, greatly increasing the risk of injury to yourself and others. You should also avoid driving when you are tired, sick, irritated, or under stress.

## Running-in

## NOTICE

The future performance and reliability of the engine depends on the care andrestraintexercisedduringits earlylife.Itisespeciallyimportantto observe the following precautions during the first 960 km of vehicle operation.

- ·After starting,do not race the engine. Warm it up gradually.
- ·Avoid prolonged vehicle operation at a constant speed. Moving parts will break in better if you vary your speed.
- Start off from a stop slowly. Avoid full throttle starts.
- Donotdriveslowlywiththetransmission in a high gear.
- Avoid hard braking， especially during the first 320 km of driving.
- ·Drive the vehicle at moderate engine speeds.

## Catalytic Converter

80G106

<!-- image -->

The purpose of the catalytic converter is to minimize the amountofharmful pollutants inyourvehicle'sexhaust.Useofleaded fuel in vehicles equipped with catalytic converters is prohibited, because lead deactivates thepollutant-reducingcomponents of the catalyst system.

The converter is designed tolast the life of the vehicle under normal usage and when unleaded fuel is used. No special maintenanceisrequiredontheconverter.However, it is very important to keep the engine properly tuned. Engine misfiring, which can result from an improperly tuned engine, may cause overheating of the catalytic converter.This mayresultinpermanent heat damage to the catalytic converter and othervehiclecomponents.
---

## Page 213
## NOTICE

To minimize the possibility of catalyticconverter or othervehicle damage:

- Maintain the engine in the proper operating condition.
- In the event of an engine malfunction, particularly one involving engine misfiring or other apparent loss of performance, have the vehicle serviced promptly.
- Do not turn off the engine or interrupt the ignition when the transmission is in gear and the vehicle is in motion.
- Do not try to start the engine by pushing or towing the vehicle, or coasting down a hill.
- Do not idle the vehicle for prolongedperiods if idlingseems roughorthereareothermalfunctions.
- Do not idle the engine with any spark plug wires disconnected or removed, such as during diagnostic testing.
- ·Do not allow the fuel tank to get near the emptylevel.
- Avoid driving .your vehicle at excessivelyhighenginespeedin oraroundtheredzoneofthe tachometer.

## WARNING

Be careful where you park and drive; thecatalytic converter andother exhaustcomponentscangetvery hot. As with any vehicle, do not park or operate this vehicle in areas where combustible materials such as dry grass or leaves can come in contact with a hotexhaust system.

## Improving Fuel Economy

## NOTE:

Fuel economy (mileage) of the vehicle may vary due to several factors i.e.,driving habits - gear change pattern, usage of A.C, Airpressure in the tyres, wind speed,trafficconditions,fuelquality-nonadulterated standardfuel，maintenanceofvehicle, road conditions,braking etc.

The following instructions will help you improve fuel economy.

## Avoid excessive idling

If you park your vehicle for more than one minute,stoptheengineandstartitagain later. When warming up a cold engine, do not allow the engine to idle or apply full throttle until the engine has reached operating temperature.Allow the engine to warm up by driving.

## Avoidsuddenacceleration

Suddenaccelerationstartingfromrestor while driving will consume fuel unnecessarily and shorten engine life. Start off slowly.

## Avoid unnecessary stops

Avoid unnecessary deceleration and stopping. Try to maintain a moderate, steady speedwheneverpossible.Slowingdown andthenacceleratingagainusesmore fuel.

## Page 214
## Keep a steady cruising speed

Drive at a constant speed that road and traffic conditions will permit.

## Keep the air cleaner clean

60A183S

<!-- image -->

If the air cleaner is clogged with dust, there willbegreaterintakeresistance,resulting indecreasedpoweroutputandincreased fuel consumption.

## Keep weight to a minimum

The heavier the load is, the more fuel the vehicleconsumes.Unloadanyunnecessary luggage or cargo.

## Keep tyre pressures correct

Under-inflation of the tyres can waste fuel duetoincreasedrollingresistanceofthe tyres. Keep your tyres inflated to the correctpressure shown inthelabel on driver's door lock pillar.

## Highway Driving

- ·Stopping distance progressively increases with vehicle speed. Apply the brakes far enough ahead of the stopping point to allow for the extra stopping distance.

When driving at highway speeds, pay attention to the following:

- On rainy days, hydroplaning can occur. Hydroplaning is the loss of direct contact betweentheroadsurfaceandthevehicle's tyres due to a water film forming between them. Steering or braking the vehicle during hydroplaning can be very difficult,and loss of control can occur. Keep speed down when the road surface is wet.
- ·At high speeds, the vehicle may be affected by side winds. Therefore, reduce speed and be prepared for unexpected buffeting, which can occur at the exits of tunnels, when passing by a cut of a hill, or when being overtaken by large vehicles, etc.

## Driving on Hills Manual transmission

<!-- image -->

## Automatictransmission

72SM04009

<!-- image -->

- ·Whenclimbing steep hills，the vehicle maybeginto slowdown and show alack of power. If this happens, you should shift to a lower gear so that the engine willagain be operating in its higher power range. Shift rapidly to prevent the vehiclefrom losing momentum.
- When driving down a hill, the engine should be used for braking by shifting to the next lower gear.
---

## Page 215
While moving uphill/gradient from a stand still condition - For manual transaxle

- Apply the parking brake firmly so that the vehicledoesnotrollbackwards.
- ·Depress the Clutch pedal and Shift the gearshift lever to 1st Select position.
- Do not slip the clutch.
- When ready to start, press accelerator pedaland slowlyrelease the clutch pedal simultaneously. When the vehicle starts to move, gradually release the parking brake.

## WARNING

Do not hold the brake pedal down too long or too often while going down a steep or long hill. This could cause thebrakes to overheat,resulting in reduced braking efficiency.Failure to take this precaution could result in lossofvehiclecontrol.

## NOTICE

When descending a downhill, never press the engine switch to change the ignition mode to "LOCK" (OFF). Emission control system and automatic transmission  (if equipped) damage may result.

## Driving on Slippery Roads

72SM04011

<!-- image -->

On wet roads, you should drive at a lower speed than you do on dry roads due to possible slippage of tyres during braking. When driving on icy, snow-covered, or muddy roads, reduce your speed and avoid sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, or sharp steering movements.

## SnowChains

Snow chains should only be used if they are needed to increase traction or are required by law. Make sure that the chains youusearethecorrectsizeforyourvehicle's tyres.Alsomakesurethatthereis enoughclearancebetweenthefenders and the chains as installed on the tyres.

Install the chains on the front tyres tightly, accordingtothechainmanufacturer's instructions. Retighten the chains after drivingabout 1.0km if necessary.Withthe chains installed, drive slowly.

## NOTICE

- ·If you hear the chains hitting against the vehicle body while driving, stop and tighten them.
- If your vehicle is equipped with full wheel caps, remove the wheel caps beforeinstallingthechainsorthe wheel caps can be damaged by the chain bands.

## Do's and Dont's for safe driving

Exercise care in handling your vehicle. Be conscious of not only your own safety but also the safety of others on the road, and thus enjoy the best and most comfortable driving experience.

Following are basic rules for safe driving. Read them carefully for good understanding of the content so that you can enjoy safe and pleasant driving in your vehicle.

## Starting

- 1） Adjust the driver's seat for the proper driving posture.
- 2）Adjust the rear view mirror so as to obtain the best possible rear view.
- 3) Before moving, look around your vehicle to confirm safety.
- 4）Don't accelerate suddenly, since it is dangerous and wastes fuel.

72RM04001

<!-- image -->

## General Driving

- 1）Be sure to stop before a stop light or stop sign. When moving into an intersection without any traffic lights or signs, drive slowly to confirm safety.
- 2）Always follow other vehicles at a safe distance in order to prevent a rear-end collision，in case the vehicle ahead makesasuddenstop.
- 3）Turn on the turn signal at least 30 meters before making a turn or changing the lanesoasnot tobehit.
- 4)B Before entering a corner,decelerate to a safe speed. Don't apply brakes during cornering, or skidding may occur.
- 5) When overtaking other vehicles, watch out for oncoming vehicles and carefully ensure safety.
- 6） Don't attempt zigzag driving as it will hinderyourcontroloverthevehicleand may cause an accident.
- 7） Avoid reckless high speed driving and trytodrive ata safe speed suitablefor the road conditions while maintaining a constant speed.
- 8）The higher the speed, the narrower the driver's visual range becomes. In such a state, it is difficult to anticipate any hazard and the driver feels fatigued.
- 9) Do not attempt sharp handling during high speed driving. You may lose your controloveryourvehicle.
- 10)When overtaking or changing lanes while driving at a high speed, keep amplevehicle-to-vehicledistance.

## Braking

72SM04015

<!-- image -->

- 1)Use the parking brake when parking your vehicle and shift the gear shift iever into the first gear or reverse gear position for the sake of safety.
- 2）Don't use hand-braking unless unavoidable. It causes the vehicle to skid and a collision may occur. It is especiallydangerous when the tyres are worn out as they skid more.

## NOTE:

Non-usage of vehicle for long duration may causegradualrustingonbrakediscsurface as it is made of cast iron. This may resultinnoise/vibration.Thesamehasno bearing on functioning of the vehicle.Regulardrivingofvehiclemayprevent/remove rust,thusreducingthenoiseandvibration.

72SM04016

<!-- image -->

Usefootbrakeinthreestages

2. Gradually apply the brake.
1. Warn the vehicle behind you.
3. 3.Bring thevehicle to a halt.
- 3) When driving downhill, try not to apply thebrakebutusetheenginebrake effectively.Overuseof the foot-brake may result in reduction of brake effectiveness.

## Long Distance Driving

- 2) Take rest at regular intervals to prevent accidents which may occur due to feeling sleepy or tired.
2. 1） Be suretoperform safety checks before starting a trip.

## Night Time Driving

72SM04017

<!-- image -->

- 1) Drive at lower speeds during the night than in the daytime, as the visual range is restricted at night.
- 2) Avoid overtaking other vehicles at night. Darkness bothers your sense of speed and hinders your judgment of vehicleto-vehicle distance.

- 3）Don't use headlights on high beam unlessitsuseisinevitable.Itmay causevisual impairment tothe driver of the oncoming vehicle or the vehicle ahead of you, which may cause an accident.
- 4）Always keep the window glasses clean. Don'toperatethewindshieldwiper when the windshield glass is dry else the wiper blade and glass may get damaged.

## Margin for safety

It is important to allow yourself a margin for safety during driving so that you can cope with erroneousor unexpected driving of other drivers.For that,observe the following.

- ·Drive at a safe speed.
- Maintain a sufficient distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead.
- Don't accelerate suddenly, steer sharply or stop suddenly.
- Don't force yourself toovertakeother vehicles.
- ·Keep ample gapsbetweendriving schedules.
- Observe traffic rules and regulations.

## Conclusion

A perfect driver does not exist. The endeavour of every motorist should be to strive for perfection.Safety consciousness not only ensures your safety and the safety of other road users,it also helps reduce the wear and tear on your vehicle, lengthens its life, gives better fuel efficiency and ensures a comfortabledrivingexperience. Follow the do's and dont'slisted,and drivingwillneverbe the sameagain.

If you do not use the air conditioner for a long period

Ensure that the air conditioner is used at least once a month, so as to circulate the refrigerant throughout the air conditioning system.The refrigerant contains the oil necessary for lubricating the system's parts, which contributes to maintaining the air conditioner's performance.

## Maintenance

If you do not use the air conditioner for a long period, such as during winter, it may not give the best performance when you start using it again. To help maintain optimum performance and durability of your air conditioner, it needs to be run periodically. Operatetheairconditioneratleastoncea month for one minute with the engine idling. This circulates the refrigerant and oil and helps protect the internal components.

Clean or replace air filter as specified in "Maintenance schedule"in"INSPECTION ANDMAINTENANCE"section.Havethis jobdonebyaMarutiSuzukiauthorised workshop as the lower glove box must be lowered for this job.

- 1) Always maintain recommended inflation pressure. Driving continuously at low inflation pressure can lead to tyre damage.
- 2) In case any leakage is found, check for any nail penetration/valve core damage or rim bent. Damaged wheel must not be used.
- 3) In case tyre has run at low pressure, it must be inspected for any defect.
- 4) Whenever new tyre is fitted, replace the valve.
5. 5)If continuous high speed driving is required, increase pressure of tyres by 5 psi over recommended inflation pressure.
- 6) Never run the tyre beyond TWl (Tread wearindicator).Thetyreisrecommended to be replaced when the remaining tread has worn to this point. The indicators are spaced across the tread around the tyre marked by a triangular symbol (TWi).
7. Always prefer tubeless tyre mounting machine. In case of manual mounting tyre/ wheel rim damage may occur.
- 8) In case of any problem, please get in touchwithaMarutiSuzukiauthorised workshop.
