59RN02200

## WARNING

If you attach accessories such as cup holders or hangers near the door, or ifyou lean umbrellas against the door, when side airbags or side curtain airbags activate,these objects may be thrown out and may not inflate properly, resulting in severe injury.

Do not attach accessories such as cup holders or hangers near the door. Also, do not lean umbrellas against the door.

## Function of Airbags How the System Works

A seat belt helps keep you in the proper position for maximum protection when an airbag inflates. Adjust your seat as far back as possible while still maintaining control of thevehicle.Sit fullyback inyour seat; sit up straight; do not lean over the steeringwheel or dashboard.Front occupants should not lean on or sleep against the door.Refer to"Seat Adjustment" section and"Seat Belts and Child Restraint Systems"sectioninthissectionfordetails onproper seat and seat belt adjustments.

In a frontal collision, the collision sensors willdetectrapiddeceleration，and if the controller judges that the deceleration represents a severe frontal collision,the controller will trigger the inflators. The inflators inflate the appropriate airbags with nitrogen or argon gas. The inflated airbags provideacushionforyourheadandupper body.The airbag inflates and deflates so quickly that you may not even realize that it has activated. The airbagwill neither hinder your view nor make it harder to exit the vehicle.

## WARNING

- ·Thedriver shouldnotleanover the steering wheel. The front passenger should not rest his or her body against the dashboard where a front air bag is mounted or a child shouldnot standinfrontof the dashboard.Otherwise,he or she willget too close to thedashboard. For vehicles with side air bags and side curtain air bag, occupants should not lean on or sleep against the door. In these situations,the out-of-position occupantwouldbe too close to an inflating airbag, and may suffer severe injury.

(Continued)

## (Continued)

- ·Do not attach any objects to,or place any objects over, the steering wheelordashboard.Donotplace any objects between the airbag and thedriverorfrontpassenger. These objects may interfere with airbag operation or may be propelled by the airbag in the event of a collision. Also, these objects may move when you start moving vehicleorwhilevehicleismoving,they may interfere with driver's view or safe driving. In each condition, it may cause severe injury.

(Continued)

- For vehicles with side airbags, do notuse non-genuine seat covers on the front seats, because non-genuine seat covers may obstruct the inflationof side airbags.Maruti Suzuki highly recommends Maruti Suzuki-genuine seat covers to be used when covering thefrontseats of suchvehicleswithside airbags. Also,near the door, do not place cup holders,hangers or any other objectsanddonotleananumbrella, as these objects could be propelled by the airbag in the event of a collision. Either of these conditions may cause severe injury.

## WARNING

## (Continued)

- ·Do not strike or apply significant levelsofimpacttotheairbagcomponent areas.It can cause the airbags to malfunction.
- Even thoughyourvehicleisdamagedbyacollision,itmaynot be severe enough to trigger front, side or side curtain airbags to inflate. If your vehicle sustains any front-end or side damage, have the airbag system inspected byMaruti Suzuki authorizedworkshoptoensurethat it works properly. If the original function of air bag system is damaged, air bag may not function effectivelyandfullyincaseofan emergency.

## ACAUTION

Airbagsmust inflatequickly and forcefullyinordertoreducethe chanceofseriousorfatalinjuries. However, an unavoidable consequenceof the quickinflationis that the airbagmayirritatebare skin, such as thefacial area against a front airbag.Washoffanyresidueassoon as possible to prevent skin irritation. Also, upon inflation, a loud noise will occurandsomepowderandsmoke willbereleased.These conditions are not harmful and do not indicate a fire in the vehicle.Be aware,however, that some airbag components may be hot for a while after inflation. This may causeburn injury.

Your vehicle is equipped with a diagnostic modulewhichrecords informationabout the airbag system if the airbags deploy in a collision. The module records information about overall system status，and which sensorsactivated thedeployment.

## Servicing the airbag system

If the airbags inflate, have the airbags and related components replaced by Maruti Suzukiauthorizedworkshopas soonas possible.

Ifyourvehicleevergetsindeepwaterand the driver's floor is submerged, the airbag controller could be damaged. If this happens,ask your Maruti Suzuki authorized workshoptochecktheairbagsystemas soon as possible.

Special procedures are required for servicingorreplacinganairbag.Forthatreason, onlyMaruti Suzuki authorized workshop shouldbeallowedtoserviceorreplace your airbags.Remind anyone whoservicesyourMarutiSuzukivehiclethatithas airbags.

To prevent damage or unintended inflation of the airbag system, check that the batteryisdisconnectedand theignitionswitch has been in"LOCK"position or the ignition modehasbeeninLOCK(OFF)for atleast 90 seconds before performing any electricalservice workonyour Maruti Suzuki vehicle.Do not touch airbag system components or wires. The wires are wrapped withyellowtapeoryellowtubing,andthe couplersareyellowforeasyidentification.

## Page 197
## WARNING

- Reduce your speed and downshift to a lower gear before going down a long or steep hill. A lower gear willallowtheenginetoprovide braking. Avoid riding the brakes or they may overheat, resulting in brake failure.
- When driving on slippery roads, slow down before downshifting. Excessive and/or sudden changes in engine speed may cause loss of traction, which could cause you to lose control.

## NOTICE

- Checkthatthevehicleiscompletely stationary beforeyou shift into reverse.
- When shifting or starting off, do not race the engine. Racing the engine can shorten engine life and cause negative effect to smooth shifting.
- To help avoid clutch damage, do not use the clutch pedal as a footrest while driving or use the clutch to keep the vehicle stationary on a slope.  Depress the clutch fully when shifting.

## NOTE:

If it is difficult to engage reverse gear [R], followbelowprocedure.

- ·Put gear lever in neutral [N] position.
- ·Releaseclutchpedalonce.
- Againdepress the clutchpedal and shift from [N] to [R].

## Automatic Transmission Gearshift lever

<!-- image -->

80T050080

The gearshift lever is designed so that it cannot be shifted out of"p"position unless the ignition switch is in "ON" position and the brake pedal is depressed.

Use the gearshift lever positions as follows:

## P (Park)

Use this position to lock the transmission when the vehicle is parked or when starting the engine. Shift into Park only when the vehicle is completely stationary.

## R (Reverse)

Use this position to reverse the vehicle from stop. Make sure that vehicle is completely stationary before shifting into Reverse.
---

## Page 198
## N (Neutral)

Use this position for starting the engine if the engine stalls and you need to restart it while the vehicle is moving. You may also shift into Neutral and depress the brake pedal to hold the vehicle stationary during idling.

## D (Drive)

Use this position for all normal driving.

With the gearshift lever in "D" range you can get an automatic downshift by pressingtheacceleratorpedal.Thehigher the vehicle speed is, the more you need to press the accelerator pedal to get a downshift.

## 2 (Low 2)

Use this position to provide extra power when climbing hills, or to provide engine braking when going down hills.

## L (Low 1)

Use this position to provide maximum power when climbing steep hills or driving through deep snow or mud,or to provide maximum engine braking when going downsteephills.

## WARNING

Always depress thebrakepedal before shifting from "p" (Park) (or "N"(Neutral)if thevehicleis stationary) to a forward or reverse gear, to help prevent the vehicle from moving unexpectedly when you shift.

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

For the vehicles with the keyless push start system, if you cannot press the engine switch firmly, the engine may not start.

Even if you shift the gearshift lever into"R"or"D"position without the engine running, the vehicle does not move.

If you try to move your vehicle under the above-mentioned condition, the vehicle may move in unexpected directions ona slope,etc.This may cause an accident. When starting the engine, press the engine switch firmly. Also, make sure that the engine is running by checking engine sound or warning and indicator lights.

## NOTE:

When you shift the gearshift lever into "P" andstoptheenginebeforedepressingthe parkingbrakepedal,ifyoutrytorestartthe engineandshiftthegearshiftleverintothe position other than "P", it may reduce gearshiftlevercapability,orunusual sound and shock may occur. However, this is not abnormal.

The cruise control system allows you to maintain a steady speed without keeping your foot on the accelerator pedal. The controls for operating the cruise control system are on the steering wheel.

You can use the cruise control system under the following conditions:

- ·For manual transmission vehicle, the gear position is in 3rd, 4th or 5th
- For automatictransmissionvehicle,the gearshift lever is in "D" position
- ·When the transfer lever is in"2H"or"4H" position
- ·When 4WD indicator light does not blink
- The vehicle speed is about 40 km/h or higher

## WARNING

To help avoid loss of vehicle control, do not use the cruise control system when driving in heavy traffic, on slippery or winding roads, or on steep downhills.

## Parking Sensors

- The parking sensor system uses ultrasonic sensors todetectobstacles near therearbumper. If obstacles are sensed while you are parking or moving the vehicle slowly, the system warns you by sounding a buzzer.
- ·Thesystememitsanultrasonicwave andtherelevantsensordetectsthe return of the wave reflected by an obstacle. The system measures the time takenbytheultrasonicwavetoreachthe obstacleandreturnfrom it,fromwhich it determines the obstacle's position.
- ·The parking sensor function canbe used when you turn the ignition switch to"ON" position or the engine switch is pressed to change the ignition mode to"ON", the gearshift lever is in the reverse position (manual transmission models) or "R' position (automatic transmission models). This function is helpful in the followingcases: pulling over tothecurb; parallel-parking the vehicle; steering the vehicle into a garage; driving along an alley; and moving slowly in a place with obstacles.

## WARNING

- The parking sensor warns you of obstacles with buzzers. However, you must still pay full attention yourself while driving.
- Thesensorscandetectobstacles only within a limited area and only whenthevehicleismovingwithina limited speed range. So, in tricky areas, you must move the vehicle slowlywhile checking aroundit usingyourdirectvisionorrearview mirrors.There is increased risk of an accident if you control the vehicle relying only on the parking sensor.

## NOTICE

Parking sensors are only for driver's assistance.

## Electronic Stability Program (ESP?)

ESP® is \_a registered trademark of Mercedes-BenzGroupAG.

The Electronic Stability Program (ESP?) helps to control thevehicle duringcorneringiffrontwheelsorrearwheelsskid.It alsoassistsyouinmaintainingtraction while accelerating on loose or slippery road surfaces. It does this by regulating the engine's output, and by selectively applying the brakes. In addition, ESP? helps to avoid skidding by controlling braking pressure.

## WARNING

The Esp cannot enhance the vehicle'sdrivingstabilityin allsituations and does not control your vehicle's entire braking system. The Esp? cannot prevent accidents, including those resulting from excessive speed in turns, or hydroplaning. Only safe and attentive drive can prevent accidents.

The capabilities of an ESp-equipped vehiclemustneverbeusedasasubstitute for careful driving.

## ACAUTION

<!-- image -->

- Observe the following points. Otherwise,Esp? maynotoperate properly or it may result in a malfunction.
- -Adjust the tyre pressure as specified.
- When replacing tyres, use the same tyres with the size, type, and tread patterns.
- -Donot use the tyres whichhave excessivelywornconditions.
- -Donotmodify the suspension or the brake and do not change vehicle height or suspension hardness.
- -Do not drive the vehicle with suspension or brake excessively deteriorated.
- Do not modify the engine or the muffler.
- Do not install LSD (limited slip differential).
- When you install the snow chains, ESp? may not operate properly.

The ESP? has the following systems:

## Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)

Refer to "Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)" in this section.

## Brake Assist System

Refer to"Brake Assist System" in this section.

## Traction Control System

The traction control system automatically helps prevent the spinning of wheels when thevehicleisstartedoracceleratedon slippery road surfaces. The system operates only if it senses that some of the wheels are spinning or beginning to lose traction. When this happens, the system operates the front or rear brakes and reduces engine power to limit wheel spin.

## NOTE:

You may hear an operation sound when youstarttheengineorafterthevehicle begins tomove.Thismeans that the abovesystemsareintheself-checkmode. This sound does not indicate a malfunction.

## Page 220
## StabilityControlSystem

Thevehiclestabilitycontrolsystemhelps provide integrated control of systems such as anti-lock brakes, traction control, engine control, etc. This system automatically controls thebrakes and engine tohelppreventthevehiclefromskiddingwhencornering on a slippery road surface or when turning the steering wheel abruptly.

## NOTE:

- ·If you perform the following operations, youmayhearanoperationsoundora clicking sound. This means that the ESP? system is in the self-check mode andthisdoesnotindicateamalfunction.

## Braking

<!-- image -->

59RN05770

The distance needed to bring any vehicle toahalt increaseswiththespeedof the vehicle.The braking distance needed,for example, at 60 km/h will be approximately 4 times greater than the braking distance neededat30km/h.Starttodepressthe brakepedalwhenthereisplentyofdistance betweenyour vehicle and the stopping point, and slow down gradually.

## WARNING

If water gets into the brake devices, brake performance may become poor and unpredictable.  After driving through water or washing the underside of the vehicle,test the brakes while driving at a slow speed to see if theyhavemaintainedtheir normal effectiveness.If the brakes areless effective than normal, dry them by repeatedly applying the brakes while drivingslowlyuntilthebrakeshave regained their normal effectiveness.

## Power-assistedBrakes

Your vehicle has power-assisted brakes. If power assistance is lost due to a stalled engine or other failures, the system is still fully operational on reserve power and you can bring the vehicle to a complete stop by pressing the brake pedal once and holding it down. The reserve power is partly used up when you depress the brake pedal and reduces each time the pedal is pressed. Apply smooth and evenpressure to the pedal. Do not pump the pedal.
---

## Page 227
## WARNING

Even without reserve power in the brake system, you can still stop the vehicle by pressing the brake pedal harder thannormallyrequired.However, the stopping distance may be longer.

## Brake Assist System

When you slam the brakes on, the brake assist system determines it tobean emergency stop and provides more powerful brakingforadriverwhocannotholddown the brake pedal firmly.

## NOTE:

Ifyouquicklyandforcefullydepressthe brakes,you may hear clicking sound by thebrakeassistsystemoperation.Thisis normalandindicatesthatthebrakeassist systemisactivatedproperly

## Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)

ABS will help you avoid skidding by electronically controlling braking pressure. It will also help you maintain steering control braking hard.

The ABS works automatically,soyou do not need any special braking technique. Justpushthebrakepedaldownwithout pumping. The ABS will operate whenever it senses that the wheels are locking up. You may feel the brake pedal move a little while the ABS is operating.

## WARNING

- ·Alwayscheckthesurroundingconditionsanddrivethevehicleina safe manner, as controlling the vehiclebyABShaslimitsandthe systemmaynotfunctionproperly dependingonthesurroundingconditions.
- If tyre grip performance is over the limit or hydroplaning occurs, ABS cannot work properly.

## NOTE:

- ·IftheABSsystemisactivated,youmay hear aclunkingnoiseand/orfeelpulsatinginthebrakepedal.Thisisnormal andindicatesthatthebrakefluidpressureisbeingcontrolledproperly.
- ·Youmayhearanoperationsoundwhen youstarttheengineorafterthevehicle beginstomove.Thismeansthatthe abovesystemsareintheself-check mode. This sound does not indicate a malfunction.

## Braking Distance

ABS is not designed to shorten the stopping distance.

## WARNING

- ·In the following situations, the braking distance required for a vehiclewith ABS may be slightly greater than the one required for a vehiclewithoutABS,resultinginan accident. Drive the vehicle slowly andmaintainample distance betweenyour vehicle and the vehicle in front of you.
- -Whendrivingonroughroads such as unpaved or stone-paved roads
- -When driving ongravel roads or fresh snowroads
- When driving over bumps on the roadssuchasjointseams
- -When passing over metal plates suchasmanholes
- Whensnowchainsareinstalled
---

## Page 228
## NOTE:

- ·If you would liketo suddenly apply brake, just push the brake pedal down firmly without pumping. Otherwise, the longerbrakingdistancewillberequired.
- When applying sudden brake or applying brake on slippery roads, the braking distancerequiredforavehiclewithABS is almost the same as the one required foravehiclewithoutABS.
- ·The ABS will not work if vehicle speed is underabout9km/h.Thisdependson theroadconditions.

## Vibration and Sound during ABS Operation

When  strongly depressing the brake pedal, you might feel vibration of the brake pedal,the steering wheel,and thevehicle body. This is due to ABS operation, and does not indicate a malfunction;continue strongly depressing the brake pedal at this time.

## NOTE:

Immediatelyafterstarting theengine and beginning to drive,you might temporarily hearamotorsound.Thismeansthatthe systemsareinself-checkmode.This sounddoesnotindicateamalfunction.

## Tyres

## WARNING

ABS detects each wheel rotation speed via a sensor. If tyres or wheels other than those specifiedinthe owner's manual are used for size, type, tread pattern, or if worn conditions of tyres are different, the correct wheel rotation speed cannot be detected and ABS wili not work properly. This may result in an accident.

When replacing tyres, use the tyres with the size, type, and tread patterns which are specified in this owner's manual.

Also, do not use the tyres which are excessively worn.

## WARNING

- ·Wear your seat belts at all times. Even though airbags are equipped at the front seating positions,the driver andallpassengers should be properly restrained at all times, using the seatbelts provided.Refer to "Seat belts and child restraint Systems" in "FOR SAFE DRIVING" section for instructions on proper useoftheseatbelts.
- Neverdriveunder theinfluenceof alcoholorotherdrugs.Alcoholand drugs can seriouslyimpair your ability to drive safely, greatly increasingtherisk ofinjury to yourselfandothers.You should alsoavoiddrivingwhenyouare tired, sick, irritated or under stress.

## Important Vehicle Design Features to Know

## WARNING

Your multipurpose vehicle has handling characteristics thatdiffer from those of a conventional passenger car.Forthesafetyofyouandyour passengers, please read the following section very carefully.

Multipurpose vehicles such as your new Maruti Suzuki have higher ground clearanceandanarrowertrackthanconventional passenger cars,to make them capable of performing in a wide variety of off-road applications. Specific design characteristicsgivethemahighercenterof gravitythan ordinary cars.Anadvantage of the higher ground clearance is a better view of the road allowing you to anticipate problems. They are not designed for corneringatthesamespeedasconventional passenger cars any more than low-slung sports cars are designed toperform satisfactorilyunder off-roadconditions.If at all possible,avoid sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers.Aswithothervehiclesofthis type,failuretooperatethisvehiclecorrectlymayresult inloss ofcontrol orvehicle rollover. Multipurpose vehicles have a significantlyhigherrolloverrate thanother types of vehicles. In a rollover collision, an unbeltedpersonissignificantlymorelikely to die thanapersonwearing aseatbelt.

## ImportantDifferencesBetween Your Multipurpose Vehicle and Ordinary Passenger Cars

## HigherGroundClearance

The higher ground clearance of your vehicleenablesittoclearoff-roadobstacles, such as rocks and tree stumps,that ordinarypassengercarscannotdriveover.An unavoidable result of this higher ground clearanceisthat thevehiclealsohasa higher center of gravity. Consequently, your vehicle will handle differently than a vehiclewith a lower center ofgravity.

## NarrowerBodyWidthandTrack

Your vehicle is narrower than the average passengercarso that itcanpass through tight spaces.Without the essential characteristics describedabove:higher ground clearance,andnarrowerbodywidthand track -your vehicle could not provide you with excellent off-road drivingperformance. However, it is also true that onroad driving,handling,and steering will be different from what drivers experience with a conventionalpassenger car.

## RolloversOn theRoadway

If, for any reason, your vehicle slides sideways or spins out of control at highway speeds,whileonthepavedportionofthe roadway,the risk of rollover is greatly increased.Thisconditioncanbecreated whentwoormorewheelsdropoffontothe shoulderandyousteersharplyinan attempt toreenter theroadway.Toreduce the risk of rollover in these circumstances, if conditions permit,you should hold the steeringwheelfirmlyandslowdown beforepullingbackintothetravellanes withcontrolled steering movements.

## All TypesofRolloverAccidents

As with many kinds of automobile accidents,rollovers canbe greatly reduced by doing what all prudent drivers should do, i.e., don't drink and drive, don't drive when tiredanddon'tdoanythingbehindthe wheelthatcouldcausealossofattention to the driving task.

Additional guidelines are set out as follows for your on-road driving.

## KnowYourVehicle

Taketimetofamiliarizeyourselfwiththe uniquehandlingcharacteristicsofyour vehicleby first drivingaround in an area awayfromtraffic.Practice turning thevehicleatavarietyofspeedsandindifferent directions.Getafeelfor thegreatersteering response that your vehicle has over a conventional car.

## WearYourSeatBeltsatAllTimes

The driver and all passengers should be properly restrained at all times, using the seat belts provided.Refer to the"SEAT BELTS"in"FORSAFEDRIVING"section for instructions on proper use of the seat belts.

## Don'tMakeSharpTurns

As mentioned before, small multipurpose vehicleshavespecificdesigncharacteristicsthatallowthemtoperforminawide variety of applications. These characteristics alsochange the corneringbehavior relativetoconventional passenger cars. Remember, small multipurpose vehicles have more responsive steering and a highercenterofgravitythanconventional passenger cars. If at all possible, avoid makingsharpturnsinyourvehicle.

## SlowDownonCurves

Learn to approach curves cautiously and at a conservative speed.Donot attempt to takecurvesat the same speeds thatyou would in avehicle with a lower center of gravity. Just as you would not drive a sports car on a trail, you should not attempt to drive your vehicle around curves like a sports car.

- ·You feel that the brake pedal is heavy to use

## WhatShouldYouDo in Caseof Malfunction or Emergency?

· Warning light turns on Stop immediately in a safe place and takecorrectiveaction. For details, refer to "Warning Lights and Indicators"in the"QUICK GUIDE"section or "Warning and indicator messages" in the "INSTRUMENT CLUSTER".

- ·You feel strong shock from under the floor

Immediately stop in a safe place and checkwhetherthereisbrakefluidleakage or fuel leakage, and also check whetherthereisanyabnormalityinthe exhaust pipe, etc. If any abnormality is found, consult with a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.

- ·Suddentyrepuncture

Grasp the steering wheel firmly, carefully apply the brake, slowly reduce speed, and stop in a safe place.

Via engine vacuum pressure, the vehicleutilizesabrakeboostertoreduce the force necessary for depressing the brake pedal. If this engine vacuum pressure decreases, you may feel as if the brakes require more force than usual to depress, but this is not abnormal.Depress the brake pedal as strongly as you need to.

- ·Metallic screeching sound is heard from the brakes

Promptly consult with a Maruti Suzuki authorizedworkshop.Thediskbrake pads (Maruti Suzuki genuine parts) are designed to emit a creaking/screeching sound as a function to warn the wear, as they have almost reached usage limit and replacement timing.

## WARNING

Thebrakes couldbelosing their ability to function normally, which couldresultinanaccident.

If you hear a metallic creaking/ screeching sound, do not continue driving.

## Use Engine Brake on a Long Downhill Slope

Use engine braking(*) in tandem with regular braking when driving on a long downhil slope.Releasetheacceleratorpedaland shift down according to vehicle speed.

## Manual transmissionvehicles

80T060010

<!-- image -->

For manual transmission vehicle, shift down to a lower gear one by one.

## Page 237
## Automatic transmission vehicles

80T060020

<!-- image -->

For automatictransmissionvehicle,turn off the overdrive (O/D）switch or shift the gearshift lever into "2" or "L".

*: Engine braking is a braking effect that occurswhenyoureleaseyourfootfrom the accelerator pedalwhile driving.The lower the gear, the greater the effect of engine braking becomes.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Continuously depressing the brake pedal could cause the brakes to overheat, possibly rendering them ineffective.

## When Side Wind Is Strong

72J20330

<!-- image -->

At a tunnel exit, on a bridge, or when a large truck passes you, your vehicle might be blown slightly sideways by side wind. Do not panic. Firmly grasp the steering wheel, gradually reduce speed, and regain your intended course.

## Drive Slowly on a Slippery Road Surface

59RN06030

<!-- image -->

Under wet road conditions you should drive at a lower speed than on dry roads due to possible slippage of tyres during braking. When driving on icy, snow-covered,or muddy roads, reduce your speed andavoid suddenacceleration,abrupt braking, or sharp steering movements. Use 4-wheel drive high range (4H) for better traction.
---

## Page 238
## NOTICE

Never operate your vehicle in "4H" or "4L" on dry pavement and, as much as possible, avoid using "4H" or "4L" onwetpavement, as thisputs severe stress on the drive train, especially during tight cornering, and can damage it. Also, you may have some difficulty in steering.

## Do not Drive on Puddles at High Speed

69RHS182

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

<!-- image -->

When driving on puddles or on wet road surfaces at high speed, a thin surfaceofwater isbuiltbetweenthe wheels and the road surface,and the wheelsmay float.Thisiscalledas hydroplaning, which leads to a loss of control in the steering wheel and the brakes and possibly results in an accident.

## Check Brake Effectiveness after Driving on Puddles or Washing a Vehicle

72J20360

<!-- image -->

- ·After verifying the safety of the surroundings, depress the brake pedal several times at low speed and check the brake effectiveness.
- If the brake effectiveness is still poor, depress the brake pedal at low speed gently and repeatedlyuntil the brake effectiveness is fully recovered, to dry the brake equipment.

## Do not Drive Through Deep or Rushing water

61M0075

<!-- image -->

Driving in deep or rushing water can be hazardous.You couldlose controlof the vehicle and the occupants could drown. Also,yourvehiclecouldbeseriouslydamaged. To avoid these risks, observe the followinginstructions andprecautions.

- ·Do not drive through deep or rushing water. Deep or rushing water, such as fast-moving streams or floodwaters, could carry your vehicle away fromyour intendedpath.Thewater is toodeepif it covers your wheel hubs, axles，or exhaust tailpipe.Knowthedepthof the water before you attempt'to drive through it.

If the vehicle goes across the river unavoidably,followtheinstructions below before going across the river.

- 1） Confirm the depth of the river and the terrain.
- 2) Select the place which is less than 30cmindepthofwater.Goacrossthe rivertoarightanglefortheriveror lowerpartoftheriver
- 3) Drive slowly at less than 5 km/h not to raise the wave and go across the river immediatelyto avoidoperatingthe gearshift lever.

If thevehiclegoes across the river thatis morethan30cmindepthofwater unavoidably，stop thevehiclein a safe placewhilecheckingthebrakeeffectiveness. Then, ask your Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop to check the following inspection items.

- ·Function of brake
- ·Function ofelectrical components
- Changes of oillevel and qualityfor engine, transmission and differential. In casethattheoil isturbidwhitely,water hasbeenmixedintheoilandanoil change is required.
- ·Lubricant conditionof thebearings,suspension joints, etc.
- If water blocks the tailpipe,the engine may not start or run. If the water is deep enough to get drawn into the engine intake system,the engine will be badly damaged.
- Submerged brakes will have poor braking performance.Drive slowly and carefully.Drivingslowlywillalsohelpavoid water splashing onto the ignition system, which could cause the engine to stall.
- Evenwhendrivingthroughshallow or stillwaters，drivecarefullysince the water may be hidingground hazards such as holes, ditches, or bumps.

## WARNING

In addition to following the driving tips in this section,it is important to observe the following precautions for on-road and off-road driving.

- ·Driver and passengers should wear seat belts at all times.
- Donotletanyone elsedriveyour vehicleunlesstheyarealsoaware ofthevehiclecharacteristicsand handling differences described in this section.
- Avoid loaningyour vehicle to anyone unless you accompany them.
- Make sure your tyres are in good conditionandalwaysmaintainthe specified tyre pressure. Refer to "Tyres"in the "INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE" section for details.

(Continued)

## Page 240
## (Continued)

- Do not use tyres other than those specified by Maruti Suzuki. Never use different sizes or types of tyres on the front and rear wheels.For information regarding  the specified tyres, refer to the"SPECIFICATIONS"section.
- After driving through water, mud, or sandy ground, test the brakes while driving at a slow speed to see if they have maintained their normaleffectiveness.If thebrakesare less effective than normal, dry them by repeatedly applying the brakes while driving slowly until the brakes have regained their normaleffectiveness.
- Never use oversized tyres or special shock absorbers and springs to raise (jack up) your vehicle. This will raise the center of gravity of the vehicle and change its handling characteristics.
- ·After extended operation in mud, sand or water,have the brakes bearings and joint parts etc. Ask your Maruti 'Suzuki authorized workshop for inspection as soon as possible

## WARNING

## Highway Driving

When driving at highway speeds, pay attention to the following:

- On rainy days, hydroplaning can occur. Hydroplaning is the loss of direct contact betweenthe roadsurface and thevehicle's tyres due to a water film forming between them.Steering or braking the vehicle during hydroplaning can be very difficult, and loss of control can occur. Keep speed down when the road surface is wet.
- Stopping distance progressively increases with vehicle speed. Apply the brakes far enough ahead of the stopping point to allow for the extra stopping distance.
- At high speeds,the vehicle may be affected by side winds. Therefore, reduce speed and be prepared for unexpected buffeting,whichcanoccuratthe exits of tunnels, when passing by a cut of a hill, or when being overtaken by large vehicles, etc.

## Driving on Hills

## Page 241
- When driving on steep hills, the vehicle maybeginto slowdown and showa lack of power. lf this happens, you should shift to a lower gear so that the engine willagain be operating inits higher powerrange.Shiftrapidlytoprevent the vehiclefrom losingmomentum.
- When driving down a hill, the engine should be used for braking by shifting to the next lower gear.

## WARNING

Donothold thebrakepedaldown too longor toooftenwhilegoingdown a steep or longhill.Thiscouldcause the brakes to overheat, resulting in reduced braking efficiency. Failure to take this precaution could result in lossofvehiclecontrol.

## NOTICE

Whendescendingadownhill,Never turn the ignition key to"LocK"positionorpresstheengineswitchto change the ignition mode to LoCK (OFF).Emissioncontrol systemand automatic transmission damage may result.

## Off-road Driving

Yourvehiclehasspecificdesign characteristicsfor off-road driving.Whenyou leave the paved road, you will encounter driving surfaces of all kinds which may change continually as you drive. In most cases, offroad driving requires the use of 4-wheel drive.

## Use Caution on Steep Inclines

Always inspect hills before you attempt to drive up them. Know what is on the other side and how you willget back down. If you have any doubt that it is safe, do not attempt to drive over a hill. Never drive your vehicle up an extremely steep incline. Coming down a steep hill can be trickier than getting up one. Keep the vehicle heading straight down the hill and use low gear.Do not lock the brakes. If the vehicle begins to slide, accelerate slightly to regain steering control.

## Do not Drive Across the Side of Hills

Driving across the side of ahillcanbe extremelyhazardous.Mostofthevehicle's weightwillbetransferredtothedownhill tyres, which could result in the vehicle rolling sideways. Whenever possible, avoid this potential hazard. Also, if you have to exit your vehicle on a side-hill, always get out on the uphill side.

## Wear Your Seat Belts at All Times

You and your passengers should use the seatbeltsatalltimeswhendrivingoffroad. For proper seat belt use,refer to the "Seat Belts"in"FORSAFEDRIVING"seCtion in this manual.

## AvoidSuddenReactionsinMud, lce,or Snow

Do not drivein the field covered with grown grass If you drive in the field covered with grass, it may cause accident or fire or vehicle damage by getting caught in grown grass.

## WARNING

If loose grass, etc. becomes entangledin drive trainparts or exhaust pipes, drive train components might become damaged or fire may result.

## If YourVehicle GetsStuck

If your vehicle gets stuck in snow, mud, or sand, follow the directions below:

- 1） Shift the transfer shift lever into the "4L" position.

Refer to"Transfer Lever"in"OPARATINGYOUR VEHICLE"sectionfor details.

- 2）Shift the transmissionback and forth betweena forward range(or firstgear for manual transmission)andreverse. This will create a rocking motion which may give you enoughmomentumto free the vehicle.Press gently on the accelerator tokeepwheel spinto a minimum.Remove your foot from the accelerator while shifting.

Do not race the engine. Excessive wheelspinwillcausethetyrestodig deeper, making it more difficult to free the vehicle.

- 3) If your vehicle remains stuck after a few minutes of rocking, get another vehicle to pull you out.

## WARNING

Do not allow anyone to stand near thevehiclewhenyouarerocking it, anddonot spinthe wheels faster thananindicated40km/honthe speedometer. Personal injury and/or vehicle damage may result from spinning the wheels toofast.

- -After driving through water, test thebrakeswhiledrivingataslow speedtoseeiftheyhavemaintained their normaleffectiveness. If thebrakesareless effective than normal, dry them by repeatedlyapplyingthebrakeswhile drivingsiowlyuntilthebrakes have regained their normal effectiveness.

## NOTICE

- ·Releasetheacceleratorpedalwhen operating thegearshiftiever or the transfer lever. Operating thegearshiftleveror thetransferleverwith the engine racing can damage the gearsand thefreeaxlemechanism.
- Do not continue rocking the vehicle for more thana fewminutes.Prolonged rocking can cause engine overheating, transmission, trans fer case, axles, propeller shaft or differential damage, or tyre damage.

## WARNING

## Improving Fuel Economy

## NOTE:

Fuel economy (mileage) of the vehicle may vary due to several factors i.e. driving habits- gear change pattern, usage of A.C, Air pressure in the tyres, wind speed, traffic conditions,fuel quality-non adulterated standard fuel，maintenance of vehicle, road conditions, braking etc.

The following instructions will help you improve fuel economy.

## Keep Tyre Pressures Correct

Under-inflationofthetyrescanwastefuel duetoincreasedrunningresistanceofthe tyres. Keep your tyres inflated to the correctpressure shown on the label on the driver'ssidedoor or thedriver'sdoor lock pillar.

## KeepWeighttoaMinimum

The heavier the load is, the more fuel the vehicle consumes.Unload anyunnecessary luggage or cargo.

## Avoid Excessive idling

If you park your vehicle for more than one minute, stop the engine and start it again later. When warming up a cold engine, do not allow the engine to idle or apply full throttle until the engine has reached operating temperature. Allow the engine to warm up by driving.

## Page 244
## Avoid Fast Starts, Rapid Acceleration and Hard Braking

## Avoidfaststarts

Fast starts away from lights or stop signs willconsume fuel unnecessarilyand shorten engine life. Start off slowly.

## Avoid unnecessary stops

Avoid unnecessary deceleration and stopping. Try to maintain a moderate, steady speed whenever possible. Slowing down and then accelerating again uses more fuel.

## Keep a steady cruising speed

Drive at a constant speed that road and traffic conditions will permit.

## Do not Race the Engine

## Catalytic Converter

80G106

<!-- image -->

The purpose of the catalytic converter is to minimizetheamountofharmfulpollutants in your vehicle's exhaust. Use of leaded fuel in vehicles equipped with catalytic converters is prohibited，because lead deactivates the pollutant-reducing components of the catalyst system.

The converter is designed to last the life of thevehicleunder normal usage and when unleaded fuel is used.No special maintenance is required on the converter. However,it isveryimportanttokeepthe engine properly tuned. Engine misfiring, which can result from an improperly tuned engine, maycauseoverheatingofthecatalytic converter. This may result in permanent heatdamagetothecatalyticconverterand othervehiclecomponents.

## Oil Level Check

80T090010

<!-- image -->

It is important tokeep the engine oil at the correct level for proper lubrication of your vehicle's engine. Check the oil level with the vehicle on a level surface. The oil level indication may be inaccurate if the vehicle is on a slope. The oil level should be checked eitherbeforestarting the engine or at least 5 minutes after stopping the engine.

Pull out the oil dipstick, wipe the oil off with a clean cloth, insert the dipstick all the way into the engine, and then remove it again. Theoilonthestickshouldbebetweenthe upper and lower limits shown on the stick. If the oil level indication is near the lower limit, add enough oil to raise the level to the upper limit.

## NOTICE

Failure to check the oil level regularly couldlead toserious engine trouble due to insufficient oil.

## Refilling

55T090140

<!-- image -->

Remove the oil filler cap and pour oil slowly through the filler hole to bring the oil level to the upper limit on the dipstick. Be careful not to overfill the oil. Toomuch oil is almost as bad as too little oil. After refilling, start the engine and allow it to idle for about a minute. Stop the engine, wait about 5 minutes and check the oil level again.

The front and rear tyre pressure specifications arelisted in the tyre informationlabel (1). Both front and rear tyres should have the specified tyre pressure.

Note that the value does not apply to the compact spare tyre, if equipped.

## Tyre Inspection

Inspect your vehicle's tyres at least once a month or before long trip by performing the following checks:

- 1) Measure the air pressure with a tyre gauge. Adjust the pressure if necessary.

## WARNING

- ·Air pressures should be checked when the tyres are cold or you may get inaccurate readings.
- Check the tyre pressure from time to time while inflating the tyre gradually,until thespecifiedpressureis obtained.
- Never under-inflate or over-inflate the tyres.

Over-inflation can cause the tyre to burst, resulting in personal injury. Over-inflationcanalsocause unusualhandlingcharacteristics whichmayresultinanaccident.

Under-inflation can cause unusual handling characteristics or can cause the rim to slip on the tyre bead, resulting in an accident or damage to the tyre or rim.

## TubelessTyres

The vehicle is equipped with Tubeless Tyres. In tubeless tyre, a thin layer of butyl rubberisusedfor lining theinsideofthe tubeless tyre.Thislayer istoprevent air loss and fulfilling the purpose of tube. The air pressure is maintained by the sealing betweentyrebeadandwheelrim.Tubeless tyres are having advantage of slow air loss and preventing sudden deflation while driving.

## Care and maintenance tips for tubeless tyres

- 2) In case any leakage is found, check for any nail penetration/valve core damage or rim bent.Damaged wheel must not be used.
2. 1）Alwaysmaintainrecommendedinflation pressure. Driving continuously at low inflation pressure can lead to tyre damage.
3. 3)In case tyre has run at low pressure,it must be inspected for any defect.
- 4) Whenever new tyre is fitted, replace the valve.
5. 5)If continuous high speed driving is required, increase tyres pressure by 5 psi over recommended inflation pressure.
- 6) Never run the tyre beyond TWl (Tread wear indicator).The tyre is recommendedtobereplacedwhenthe remaining tread has worn to this point. Theindicators are spacedacross the tread around the tyre marked by a triangular symbol (TWI).
7. 7）Always prefer tubeless tyre mounting machine. In case of manual mountingtyre/wheel rim damagemay occur.
8. 8）In case of any problem,please get in touch with a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.
