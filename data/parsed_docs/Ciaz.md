## Page 60
## Conditions when front airbags may inflate

Receiving a strong impact to the lower body of your vehicle, the front airbags may inflate.

<!-- image -->

80J099

- ·Hitting a curb or medial strip

<!-- image -->

80J100E

- Falling into a deep hole or ditch
- Landing hard or falling

<!-- image -->

## Front airbags may not inflate

Also, front airbags may not inflate in many cases when the collision angle is greater than about 30 degrees at ieft and right angles from the front of your vehicle.

The front airbags may not inflate when a strong impact has not occurred since the collision object (including living being like animals） was easy to be deformed or moved, or the collided portion of your vehicle was easy to be deformed.

Also, in certain collisions at low speed, the air bags may not inflate.

## Howthesystemworks

In a frontal collision, the crash sensors will detect rapid deceleration,and if the controller judges that the deceleration represents  a severefrontalcrash，the controller will trigger the inflators. The inflators inflate theair bagswith nitrogenor argon gas. The inflated air bags provide a cushion for your head and upper body. The airbaginflatesanddeflatessoquicklythat you may not even realize that it has activated.The airbagwill neitherhinderyour view nor make it harder to exit the vehicle.

Air bags must inflate quickly and forcefully inorder toreduce thechanceofserious or fatal injuries. However, an unavoidable consequence of the quick inflation is that the air bag may irritate bare skin, such as the facial area.Also, upon inflation, a loud noise will occur and some powder and smoke will be released. These conditions arenotharmfulanddonotindicateafirein the vehicle.Be aware,however, that some air bag\_components may be hot for a while after inflation.

- The light comes on when the parking brake is engaged with the ignition switch in "ON" position or the ignition mode is "ON".
- The light comes on under either or both ofabovetwoconditions.

The light also comes on when the fluid in thebrakefluidreservoirfallsbelowthe specified level.

The light should go out after starting the engine and fully releasing the parking brake,if thefluidlevelinthebrakefluid reservoiris adequate.

The light also comes on together with the ABS warning light when the rear brake force control function (proportioning valve function) of the ABS system fails.

If thebrakesystemwarninglightcomeson while you are driving the vehicle, it may mean that there is something wrong with the vehicle's brake system. If this happens:

- 1) Pull off the road and stop carefully.

## WARNING

Remember that stopping distance may be longer, you may have to push harder on the pedal, and the pedal may go down farther than normal.

- 2) Test the brakes by carefully starting and stopping thevehicle on the shoulder of the road.
2. 3）If you determine that it is safe,drive the vehiclecautiouslyatlowspeedtothe nearest dealer for repairs or tow the vehicletothenearestdealerforrepairs.

## Engine Oil Consumption

It is normal for the engine to consume some engine oil during normal vehicle operation.

The amount of engine oil consumed depends on the viscosity of the oil，the quality of the oil and the conditions under which thevehicleisdriven.

More oil is consumed during high-speed driving and when there is frequent acceleration and deceleration. Under high loads, alsoyourenginealsowillconsumemore oil.

A newengine alsoconsumesmore oil, since its pistons, piston rings and cylinder walls have not yet become conditioned. New engines reach the normal level of oil consumption only  after approximately 5000 km driving.

## Oil consumption: Max.1.0 L per 1000 km

When judging the amount of oil consumption, note that the oil may become diluted and make it difficult to accurately judge the true oil level.

As an example, if a vehicle is used for repeated short trips,and consumes a normal amount of oil, the dipstick may not show any drop in the oil level at all, even after 1000 km or more of driving. This is because the oil is gradually becoming diluted with fuel or moisture, making it appear that the oil level has not changed.

You should also be aware that the diluting ingredients evaporate out when thevehicle is subsequently driven at high speeds, such as on an expressway, making it appear that oil is excessively consumed after high-speed driving.

## Clutch Pedal (1) (For manual transaxle)

The clutch pedal is used to disengage the drive to the wheels when starting the engine, stopping, or shifting the gearshift lever. Depressing the pedal disengages the clutch.

## WARNING

Do not drive with your foot resting on the clutch pedal.It couldresult in excessiveclutchwear,clutchdamage, or unexpected loss of engine braking.

## Brake Pedal (2)

Your MARUTI SUZUKI vehicle is equipped with front disc brakes and rear drum brakes. Depressing the brake pedal applies both sets of brakes.

You may hear occasional brake squeal when you apply the brakes. This is a normal condition caused by environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, snow or dust, etc.

## WARNING

If brake squealis excessive and occurs each time the brakes are applied, you should have the brakes checked by your Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

## WARNING

Do not ""ride" the brakes by applying them continuously or resting your foot on the pedal. This will result in overheating of the brakes which could cause unpredictable braking action, longer stopping distances, or permanent brake damage.

## WARNING

For automatic transaxle - You may hear occasional sound when you slowlyreleasebrakepedalwhile vehicle is in "D" (Drive) mode. This is normal as vehicle's tendency is to move slowly and brakes are trying to stop thevehicle simultaneously.

## Accelerator Pedal (3)

This pedalcontrols the speed of the engine.Depressing theaccelerator pedal increasespoweroutputandspeed.

The electronic control system monitors driving condition(such as vehicle speed and/or engine revolution),，and it shows which gear position is optimal for your driving with the indication on the display.

If UP/DOwN arrow and the gear position otherthancurrentlyselectedareindicated on the display while driving，we recommendyoutoshiftupordownthegear to indicated position.Itis theoptimalgear positionforadrivingconditionthatreduces theoverrevolutionandstresstothe engine, and improves fuel economy.

For details on how to use the transaxle, refer to "Using the Transaxle" in this section.

## WARNING

The gearshift indicator is designed to indicate optimal gear position for your driving, however, a driver will notberelievedfromthedutyofcare of driving operation or gear change with this indicator.

To drive safe, do not gaze the gearshift indicator, pay attention to your driving situation and shiftup or down if necessary.

NOTE:

- ·Thegearshiftindicatorisnotindicated when the gear positionisin"N"(Neutral).

## Smart Hybrid

SmartHybridhasanIntegratedStarter Generator(ISG）insteadofconventional generator for a better fuel economy.

Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) is a generatorwhichincorporatesamotorfunction.

The ISG has the following 3 functions.

- Deceleration energy regenerating function
- Engine power assist function
- ·Startermotorfunction

## WARNING

Dripping engine oil, brake fluid and coolant,etc.totheISGmaycausea fire or malfunction.Do not spill them when pouring.

## Page 138
## Deceleration energy regenerating function

79MM03027

<!-- image -->

While decelerating your vehicle, the ISG generates electricity without engine power. This reduces engine loads and improves fuel economy.

While decelerating your vehicle, deceleration energy regenerating function will be activated when the following conditions are satisfied.

- ·The clutch pedal is not depressed (for manual transaxle)or thebrakepedalis not depressed (for automatic transaxle).
- The gearshift lever is not in "N" (Neutral) position.
- Engine speed is more than 1050 rpm (for manual transaxle) or more than 950 rpm (for automatic transaxle).

## NOTE:

Thedecelerationenergyregenerating functionmaynotworkdependingonvehicle conditions.

## Engine power assist function

79MM03028

<!-- image -->

While the vehicle is running, ISG assists engine power as a motor in limited condition. This reduces engine loads and improvesfueleconomy.

While the vehicle is running with the engine speed at approximately 3900 rpm or less, engine power assist function will be activated when all of the following conditions aresatisfied.

- Smart Hybrid system and ENG A-STOP system are working properly. ("ENG ASTOP OFF" indicator light is not blinking.)
- ABS/ESP? is not activated.
- The clutch pedal is not depressed (for manual transaxle)or the brake pedal is not depressed (for automatic transaxle).
- ·Accelerator pedal  is excessively depressed.
- Lead-acid battery and lithium-ion battery are fully charged and inside temperature isinnormalconditionforboth the batteries.
- ·Engine coolant temperature is in normal condition.
- ·ISG inside temperature is in normal condition.

## NOTE:

- The engine power assist function may not work dependingonvehicle conditions.
- Thesubjectivefeelingofthehornsound and A/Cblower speed is likely tobe differentwhenthedecelerationenergy regeneratingfunctionandenginepower assistfunctionareactive.
- The engine power assist function may not work while the battery capacity is being checked right after the engine start, and so on.

## Startermotorfunction

79MM03029

<!-- image -->

After the engine auto stops by the ENG A-STOP system, the engine will be restarted using cranking power of the ISG.

The starting with the ISG is quiet compared with starting by the conventional starter motor.

## NOTE:

When you restart the engine by turning the ignitionswitchorbypushing theengine switch,theconventionalstartermotoris used and you will heara gear engagement sound.

## Lithium-ion battery indication

This function is helpful in the following cases: pulling over to the curb; parallel-parking thevehicle; steering the vehicle into a garage, driving along an alley; and movingslowlyinaplacewithobstacles.

## WARNING

- The parking sensor warns you of obstacles with buzzers However, you must still pay full attention yourselfwhile driving.
- The sensors can detect obstacles only within a limited area and only whenthevehicleismovingwithina limited speed range. So,in tricky areas,you must move the vehicle slowly while checking aroundit usingyourdirectvisionorrearview mirrors.

## Braking

60G165S

<!-- image -->

The distance needed to bring any vehicle to a halt increases with the speed of the vehicle. The braking distance needed, for example, at 60 km/h will be approximately 4 times greater than the braking distance needed at 30 km/h. Start to brake the vehiclewhenthereisplentyofdistance between your vehicle and the stopping point, and slow down gradually.

## Page 158
## WARNING

If water gets into the brake devices, brakeperformancemaybecomepoor and unpredictable. 'After driving throughwater or washing the undersideofthevehicle,testthebrakes whiledriving ata slowspeed to see if theyhave maintained their normal effectiveness.If thebrakesareless effective than normal,dry them by repeatedlyapplyingthebrakeswhile drivingslowlyuntilthebrakeshave regained their normal effectiveness.

## Power-AssistedBrakes

Your vehicle has power-assisted brakes. If powerassistanceislostduetoastalled engineorotherfailures,thesystemisstil fully operational on reserve power and you canbringthevehicletoacompletestopby pressingthebrakepedalonceandholding it down. The reserve power is partly used upwhenyoudepressthebrakepedaland reduceseachtimethe pedalispressed. Apply smooth and evenpressure to the pedal. Do not pump the pedal.

## WARNING

Even without reserve power in the brake system,you can stillstop the vehiclebypressing thebrakepedal harder thannormallyrequired.However, the stopping distance may be longer.

## BrakeAssistSystem

When you slam the brakes on, the brake stop and provides more powerful braking foradriverwhocannotholddownthe brakepedal firmly.

## NOTE:

Ifyou quicklyandforcefullydepressthe brakes, you may hear a clicking sound in the brake pedal. This is normal and indicates that the brake assist system is activated properly.

## Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS)

ABSwillhelpyou avoidskiddingbyelectronically controlling braking pressure.It will also help you maintain steering control when braking on slippery surfaces or when brakinghard.

The ABS works automatically,soyou do not need any specialbrakingtechnique. Justpushthebrakepedaldownwithout pumping. The ABS will operate whenever itsensesthat thewheelsarelockingup. You may feel the brake pedal moves a little while the ABS is operating.

## NOTE:

- ·TheABSwillnotworkifvehiclespeedis underabout9km/h.

## WARNING

- On some types of loose surfaces (suchas gravel,  snow-covered roads,etc.)the stopping distance requiredforanABS-equippedvehiclemaybe slightly greater thanfor acomparablevehiclewithaconventionalbrakesystem.Withaconventional brake system, skidding tires are able to"plow"the gravel orsnowlayer,shorteningthestopping distance. ABS minimizes this resistance effect.Allowfor extra stopping distance when driving on loose surfaces.
- In both of the above conditions, ABSwillstilloffertheadvantageof helping you maintain directional control. However, remember that ABS willnot compensate for bad roadorweatherconditionsorpoor driverjudgment.Usegoodjudgmentanddonotdrivefasterthan conditionswillsafelyallow.
- Onregular paved roads, some driversmay be able to obtain slightly shorter stoppingdistanceswith conventional brake systems than withABS.

## WARNING

- ·If the ABS warning light (1) on the instrument panel comes on and stays on while driving, there may be a problem with the ABS system. Ask your Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop to inspect the ABS systemimmediately.IftheABSsystem becomes inoperative, the brake system will function as an ordinary brake system that has no ABS.

(Continued)

## (Continued)

- If the ABS warning light (1) and the Brake system warning light (2) on theinstrumentpanelsimultaneouslystaysonorcomesonwhen driving, both anti-lock function and rearbrakeforcecontrolfunction (proportioning valve function)of the ABS system may have failed. If so, the rear wheels may easily skid or the vehicle can even spin in the worst case when braking on a slippery road or when hard braking even on a dry paved road.Ask your MarutiSuzukiauthorisedworkshop to inspect the ABS system immediately. Drive carefully, avoiding hard braking as much as possible.

## WARNING

## HowtheABSWorks

A computer continuously monitors wheel speed.' The computer  compares the changes inwheelspeedwhenbraking.If the wheels slow suddenly,indicating a skidding situation, the 'computer will change brakingpressure several times eachsecond toprevent thewheelsfrom locking. When you start your vehicle after a stop, you may hear a momentary motor or clicking noise easthesystemresetsor checks itself.

## WARNING

The ABS may not work properly if tyres or wheels other than those specified in the owner's manual are used.ThisisbecausetheABSworks by comparing changes in wheel speed. When replacing t tyresor wheels, use only the size and type specified in this owner's manual.

## Electronic stability program (ESP?) (if equipped)

ESP? is a registered trademark of Daimler AG.

The Electronic Stability Program (ESP?) helps to control the vehicle during cornering if front wheels or rearwheels skid.It also assists you in maintaining traction while acceleratingonloose or slippery road surfaces.It does this by regulating theengine's output,and byselectively applying the brakes. In addition, ESP? helps to avoid skidding by controlling braking pressure.

## WARNING

The ESp? cannot enhance the vehicle'sdrivingstabilityinallsituations anddoesnotcontrolyourvehicle's entire braking system. The Esp cannot prevent accidents, including thoseresultingfromexcessive speed in turns, or hydroplaning.Only safe and attentive drive can prevent accidents. The capabilities of an ESP? equippedvehiclemustneverbeused as a substitute for careful driving.

The ESP? has the following three systems:

## Stability control system

The vehicle stability control system helps provide integrated control of systems such as anti-lockbrakes,traction control,engine control，etc.Thissystemautomatically controls the brakes and engine to help preventthevehiclefromskiddingwhencorneringonaslipperyroadsurfaceorwhen turningthesteeringwheelabruptly.

## Traction control system

The traction control system automatically helps prevent the spinning of wheels when thevehicleisstartedoracceleratedon slippery road surfaces. The system operwheels are spinning or beginning to lose atesonlyif itsensesthatsomeofthe traction. When this happens, the system operates the front or rear brakes and reduces engine power to limit wheel spin.

## NOTE:

You mayhear a clunking sound whenyou start the engine or after thevehiclebegins tomove.Thismeansthattheabovesystemsareintheself-checkmode.This sounddoesnotindicateamalfunction.

## Anti-lockbrake system (ABS)

## Catalytic Converter

<!-- image -->

79MM03014

The purpose of the catalytic converter is to minimize the amountofharmful pollutants inyourvehicle'sexhaust.Useofleaded fuel in vehicles equipped with catalytic convertersis prohibited，because lead deactivates the pollutant-reducing components of the catalyst system.

The converter is designed to last the life of thevehicleundernormalusageandwhen unleaded fuel is used. No special maintenance is required ontheconverter.However,itisveryimportanttokeep theengine properly tuned. Engine misfiring, which can result from an improperly tuned engine, may cause overheating of the catalyst. This may result in permanent heat damage tothecatalystandothervehiclecomponents.

## Page 167
## NOTICE

To minimize the possibility of catalyst or other vehicle damage:

- In the event of an engine malfunction, particularly one involving engine misfire or other apparent lossofperformance,havethevehicle serviced promptly.
- Maintain the engine in the proper operating condition.
- Do not turn off the engine or interrupt the ignition when the transaxle is in gear and the vehicle is in motion.
- Do not idle the engine with any spark plug wires disconnected or removed, such as during diagnostic testing.
- Do not try to start the engine by pushing or towing the vehicle, or coasting down a hill.
- Do not idle the vehicle for prolonged periodsif idlingseems roughorthereareothermalfunctions.
- Do not allow the fuel tank to get near the empty level.

Be careful where you park and drive; the catalytic converter and other exhaust components canget very hot.Aswithanyvehicle,donotpark or operate this vehicle in areas where combustible materials such as dry grass or leaves can come in contact with ahotexhaust system.

## Improving Fuel Economy

## NOTE:

Fuel economy (mileage) of the vehicle may vary due to several factors i.e., driving habits - gear change pattern, usage of A.C, Air pressure in the tyres, wind speed, trafficconditions,fuelquality-nonadulterated standard fuel, maintenance of vehicle, road conditions, braking etc.

The following instructions will help you improve fuel economy.

## Avoid excessive idling

If you are to wait for more than a minute whileyouareparked,stoptheengineand start it again later. When warming up a coldengine,allow theenginetoidleuntil the temperature gauge pointer comes up to the "C" position (if the idling is not prohibited). In this position, the engine is sufficientlywarmforstarting off.

## Avoid "fast'" starts

Fast starts away from lights or stop signs will consume'fuel unnecessarily and shorten engine life. Start off slowly.

## Avoid unnecessary stops

Avoid unnecessary deceleration and stopping. Try to maintain a slow, steady speed wheneverpossible.Slowingdownand then accelerating again uses more fuel.

## Keep a steady cruising speed

Keep as constant a speed as road and traffic conditions will permit.

## Page 168
## Keep the air cleaner clean

60A183S

<!-- image -->

If the air cleaneris clogged with dust,there will be greater intake resistance, resulting indecreasedpoweroutputandincreased fuel consumption.

## Keep weight to a minimum

The heavier the load, the more fuel the vehicle consumes. Take out any luggage or cargo when it is not necessary.

## Keep tire pressures correct

Underinflationofthetirescanwastefuel due to increased running resistance of the tires. Keep your tires inflated to the correct pressure shown on the label on the driver's side door or the driver's door lock pillar.

## Highway Driving

- ·Stopping distance progressively increaseswithvehiclespeed.Applythe brakes far enough ahead of the stopping point to allow for the extra stopping distance.

When driving at highway speeds, pay attention to the following:

- On rainy days,"Hydroplaning"can occur."Hydroplaning"is the loss of direct contactbetweentheroadsurfaceand thevehicle'stiresduetoawaterfilm forming between them. Steering or braking the vehicle while "Hydroplaning" can bevery difficult,and lossofcontrolcan occur.Keepspeed downwhentheroad surface is wet.
- At high speeds, the vehicle may be affected by side winds. Therefore, reduce speed and be prepared for unexpected buffeting, which can occur at the exits of tunnels, when passing by a cut of a hill, or when being overtaken by large vehicles, etc.

## Driving on Hills

<!-- image -->

79M04001

- ·When climbing steep hills, the vehicle maybegintoslowdownandshowalack of power. lf this happens, you should shift to a lower gear so that the engine willagain be operating in its normal power range. Shift rapidly to prevent the vehicle from losing momentum.
- Whendriving downa hill,the engine should be used for braking by shifting to next lowergear.(Dothiswitheitheraautomatic transaxle or manual transaxle.)
---

## Page 169
## WARNING

Trynottoholdthebrakepedaldown toolong or too often while going down a steep or long hill. This could cause thebrakes tooverheat,resultingin reduced braking efficiency. Failure to take this precaution could result inloss ofvehicle control.

## While moving uphill/gradient from a standstillcondition-Formanual transaxle

- ·Apply the parking brake firmly so that the vehicledoesnotrollbackwards.
- ·DepresstheClutchpedalandShift the gearshift lever to 1st Select position.
- Do not slip the clutch.
- Whenreadytostart,pressaccelerator pedalandslowlyreleasetheclutch pedal simultaneously.Whenthevehicle starts to move, gradually release the parking brake.

## NOTICE

Whendescending la down hill, NEVER turn the ignition key to the "LocK" position or press the engine switch to change the ignition mode to "LOCK"(OFF).Emissioncontrolsystemandautomatictransaxle(if equipped) damage may result.

## Driving on Slippery Roads

79MM04003

<!-- image -->

Under wet road conditionsyou should driveatalowerspeedthanondryroads due to possible slippage of tires during braking. When driving on icy, snow-covered,or muddy roads,reduce your speed andavoid suddenacceleration,abrupt braking,orsharpsteeringmovements.

## Tire Chains

Tire chains should only be used if they are needed to increase traction or are required by law.Makesurethat thechainsyouuse arethecorrectsizeforyourvehicle'stires. Alsomakesurethatthereisenoughclearance between thefenders and the chains as installed on the tires.

Install the chains on the front tires tightly, accordingtothechainmanufacturer's instructions.Retightenthechainsafter driving about 1.0 km(1/2 mile）if necessary. With the chains installed, drive slowly.

## NOTICE

- If you hear the chains hitting against the vehicle body while driving, stop and tighten them.
- Ifyourvehicleisequippedwithfull wheelcaps,removethewheelcaps before installing the chains or the wheel caps can be damaged by the chain bands.

## If YourVehicle GetsStuck

If your vehicle gets stuck in snow, mud, or sand,follow the directions below:

- 1） Shift the transaxle back and forth betweenaforwardrange(or firstgear formanualtransaxle)andreverse.This will create a rocking motion which may giveyou enoughmomentum tofreethe vehicle. Press gently on the accelerator tokeepwheel spinning to a minimum wheelrpm.Removeyourfootfromthe accelerator while shifting.

Do not race the engine.Excessive wheel spin will cause the tires to dig deeper, making it more difficult to free thevehicle

- 2) If your vehicle remains stuck after a few minutes of rocking, we recommend you to consult your Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop or a roadside assistance service. If a towing service is not available in an emergency, your vehicle may be temporarily towed by a towing cable or chain secured to the towing

## Page 173
## Braking

- 2) Don't use handbraking unless unavoidable.Itcauses thevehicletoskid and a rearend collision occur. It is especially dangerous when the tyres are worn, for they allow a larger skid.
2. 1)Use the parking brake when parking your vehicle and shift the gear shift iever into the first gear or reverse gear position for the sake of safety.

79MM04007

<!-- image -->

Use foot brake in three stages

1. Warn the vehicle behind you
2. Gradually apply the brake.
3. 3.Bring the vehicle to a halt.
4. 3）When driving on a downhill, try not to apply the brake but use the engine brakeeffectively.Overuseof the foot-brake may result in total brake failure.
- 4) Avoid reckless high speed driving and trytodriveatasafespeedsuitablefor the road conditions while maintaining a constant speed.
6. 5） The higher the speed, the narrower the driver's visual range becomes. In such a state, it is difficult to anticipate any hazardandthedriverfeelsmuch fatigued.
- 6) Never do sharp handling during high speed driving. You will lose your control overyourvehicle.
8. 7） When overtaking or changing the lane while driving at a high speed,keep an ample vehicle-to-vehicle distance.

## Maintenance

If you do not use the air conditioner for a long period, such as during winter, it may not give the best performance when you start using it again. To help maintain optimum performance and durability of your air conditioner, it needs to be run periodically. Operate the air conditioner at least once a month for one minute with the engine idling. This circulates the refrigerant and oil and helps protect the internal components.

If your air conditioner is equipped with air filters, clean or replace them as specified in the "Maintenance Schedule""in the "INSPECTIONANDMAINTENANCE"SeCtion.

## NOTE:

Your vehicle uses the air conditioning refrigerant HFC-134a,commonly called "R-134a".R-134a replaced R-12 around 1993forautomotiveapplications.Other refrigerants are available, including recycled R-12,butonlyR-134ashouldbeused inyourvehicle.

## NOTICE

Using thewrong refrigerant may damage your air conditioning system. Use R-134a only. Do not mix or replace the R-134a with other refrigerants.

## Vehicle Loading

Yourvehiclewasdesignedforspecific weight capacities. The weight capacities of yourvehicleareindicatedbytheGross Vehicle Weight Rating(GVWR)and the Permissible maximum Axle Weight (PAW, frontandrear).TheGVWRandPAW(front and rear）are listed in the "SPECIFICATIONS"section.

GVWR - Maximum permissible overall weight of the fully loaded vehicle (including all the occupants, accessories and cargo plus the trailer nose weight if towing a trailer).

PAW-(Front and Rear)Maximumpermissible weight on an individual axle.

Actualweightoftheloadedvehicleand actual loads atthefrontandrearaxlescan onlybedeterminedbyweighingthevehicle. Compare these weights to the GVWR and PAw (front and rear). If the gross vehicleweightortheloadoneitheraxle exceeds these ratings,you must remove enoughweighttobringtheloaddownto the rated capacity.

## WARNING

Never overload your vehicle. The gross vehicle weight (sum of the weights of the vehicle, all the occupants, accessories, cargo plus trailer nose weight if towing a trailer) must never exceed the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). In addition, neverdistributealoadsothatthe weightoneitherthefrontorrearaxle exceeds the Permissible maximum Axle Weight (PAW).

## WARNING

Always distribute cargo evenly. To avoid personal injury or damage to your vehicle, always secure cargo to prevent it from shifting if the vehicle movessuddenly.Placeheavier objects on the floor and as far forward in the cargo area as possible. Never pile cargo higher than the top of the seat backs.

To avoid uneven wear of your tyres and to prolong their life, rotate the tyres as illusrated.Tyresshouldberotatedasmentionedinperiodicmaintenanceschedule. After rotation，adjust front and rear tyre pressures tothe specificationlistedon your vehicle's Tyre Inflation Pressure Label.

## Wheel Balancing

Ifthevehiclevibratesabnormallyon smoothroad,havethewheelbalanceda Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

## WheelAlignment

In case of abnormal tyre wear or pulling towards one side,have the wheel aligned a Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

## TubelessTyres

The vehicle is equipped with Tubeless Tyres. In tubeless tyre, a thin layer of butyl rubber is used for lining the inside of the tubeless tyre. This layer is to prevent air loss and fulfilling the purpose of tube. The airpressureismaintainedbythesealing between tyre bead and wheel rim. Tubelesstyresarehavingadvantageofslowair loss and preventing sudden deflation while driving.

## Care and maintenance tips for tubeless tyres

- 2) In case any leakage is found, check for any nail penetration/valve core damage or rim bent. Damaged wheel must not be used.
- 1) Always maintain recommended inflation pressure. Driving continuously at low inflation pressure can lead to tyre damage.
- 3) In case tyre has run at low pressure, it must be inspected for any defect.
4. 4）Whenever new tyre is fitted,replace the valve.
5. 5）If continuous high speed driving is required, increase pressure\_of tyres by 5 psi over recommended inflation pressure.
6. 6） Never run the tyre beyond TWl (Tread wearindicator).Thetyreisrecom-

mended to be replaced when the remainingtreadhasworntothispoint. Theindicatorsare spacedacross the tread around the tyre marked by a triangular symbol (TWI).

- 8) In case of any problem, please get in touchwithMarutiSuzukiauthorised workshop.
2. 7A Always prefer tubeless tyre mounting machine. In case of manual mounting tyre/wheel rimdamagemayoccur.
