Front airbags are designed to inflate in severe frontal collisions when the ignition mode is ON.

NOTE: In a frontal angle collision, the side airbags and side curtain airbags may inflate.

Front airbags are not designed to inflate in rear impacts,side impacts,rollovers or minor frontal collisions, since they would offer no protection in those types of accidents. Since an airbag deploys only one time during an accident, seat belts are neededtorestrainoccupantsfromfurther movements during the accident.

Therefore, an airbag is not a substitute for seat belts. To maximize your protection, always fasten your seat belts. Be aware that no system can prevent all possible injuries that may occur in an accident.

## Side airbags and side curtain airbags

68KM090

Side airbags and side curtain airbags are designed to inflate in severe side impact collisions when the ignition mode is ON.

Side airbags and side curtain airbags are not designed to inflate in frontal or rear collisions, rollovers or minor side collisions, since they would offer no protection in those types of accidents. Only the side airbag and side curtainairbag on the side of the vehicle that is struck will inflate.However, in a frontal angle collision, the side airbags and side curtain airbags may inflate.Sinceanairbagdeploysonlyone time during an accident, seat belts are needed to restrain occupants from further movements during the accident.

Therefore, an airbag is not a substitute for seat belts. To maximize your protection, always fasten your seat belts. Be aware that no system can prevent all possible injuries that may occur in an accident.

## WARNING

If you attach accessories such as cup holders or hangers near the door, or if you lean umbrellas against the door, when side airbags or side curtain airbags activate, these objects may be thrown out and may not inflate properly, resulting in severe injury.

Do not attach accessories such as cup holders or hangers near the door. Also, do not lean umbrellas against the door.

## Function of Airbags

## How the System Works

In a frontal collision, the collision sensors will detect rapid deceleration, and if the controller judges that the deceleration represents a severe frontal collision, the controller will trigger the inflators. The inflators inflate the appropriate airbags with nitrogen or argon gas. The inflated airbags provide a cushion for your head and upper body.The airbaginflatesanddeflatesso quickly that you may not even realize that it has activated. The airbag will neither hinder your view nor make it harder to exit the vehicle.

A seat belt helps keep you in the proper positionfor maximumprotectionwhenan airbag inflates. Adjust your seat as far back as possible while still maintaining control of the vehicle. Sit fully back in your seat; sit up straight; do not lean over the steering wheel ordashboard.Frontoccupants should not lean on or sleep against the door. Refer to "Seat Adjustment" section and "Seat Belts and Child Restraint Systems"section in this sectionfor details on proper seat and seat belt adjustments.

## WARNING

- Thedrivershouldnotleanoverthe steering wheel. The front passenger should not rest his or her body against the dashboard where a front airbagismounted or a child shouldnotstandinfrontofthe dashboard.Otherwise,he or she will get too close to the dashboard. For vehicles with side air bags and side curtain air bag,occupants should not lean on or sleep against the door.In these situations,the out-of-positionoccupantwouldbe too close to an inflating airbag, and may suffer severe injury.

(Continued)

## WARNING

## (Continued)

- For vehicles with side airbags, do notusenon-genuineseatcoverson the front seats,because non-genuine seat covers may obstruct the inflation of side airbags. Maruti Suzuki highly recommends Maruti Suzuki-genuine seatcovers tobe usedwhencoveringthefrontseats of such vehicles with side airbags. Also, near the door, do not place cup holders, hangers or any other objects and do not lean an umbrella, as theseobjectscouldbepropelled by the airbag in the eventof acollision. Either of these conditions may cause severe injury.
- ·Do not attach any objects to, or place any objects over, the steering wheel or dashboard. Do not place any objects between the airbag and the driver or front passenger. These objects may interfere with airbag operation or may be propelled by the airbag in the event of a collision. Also, these objects may move when you start moving vehicle or while vehicle is moving, they may interfere with driver's view or safe driving. In each condition, it may cause severe injury.

(Continued)

## WARNING

## (Continued)

- Do not strike or apply significant levels ofimpact tothe airbagcomponent areas. It can cause the airbags to malfunction.
- Even though your vehicle is damaged by a collision, it may not be severe enough to trigger front, side or side curtain airbags to inflate. If your vehicle sustains any front-end or side damage, have the airbag system inspected byMaruti Suzuki authorized workshop to ensure that it works properly. If the original function of air bag system is damaged, air bag may not function effectively and fully in case of an emergency.

As an added fuel efficiency feature, your vehicleisequippedwithatyrepressure monitoring system (TPMS) that uses a low tyre pressure warning light to inform you when one or more of your tyres is significantlyunder-inflated.

When the ignition switch or the power switch is pressed to change the ignition mode to ON,this light comes on briefly so you can check that the light is working.

When the low tyre pressure warning light is lit, one or more of your tyres is significantly under-inflated.Youshouldstopandcheck your tyres as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure as indicated onthevehicle'styreinformationplacard. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tyrecausesthetyretooverheatandcan leadtotyrefailure.Under-inflationalso reduces fuel efficiency and tyre tread life, andmayaffect thevehicle'shandlingand stopping ability. Each tyre, including the spare(optional)，should be checked at leastonceamonthwhencoldandsetto the recommended inflation pressure as specified in the vehicle placard.

The low tyre pressure warning light is also used to informyou of aTPMSmalfunction. When the system detects a malfunction, this light will blink for about 75 seconds and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will be repeated after the ignitionswitchor the power switchis pressedtochange theignitionmodeto ON" as long as the malfunction exists.

- (1) Symbol representing an obstacle detected by parking sensor*
* This symbol shows that an obstacle is located on the right rear of vehicle.
3. The parking sensor system uses ultrasonicsensorstodetectobstaclesnear the rear bumper. If obstacles are sensed while you are parking or moving the vehicle slowly, the system warns you by sounding a buzzer and displaying symbols representing the obstacles on the information  display  in  the instrument cluster.
4. The system emits an ultrasonic wave andtherelevantsensordetectsthe return of the wave reflected by an obstacle. The system measures the time taken by the ultrasonic wave to reach the

obstacleandreturnfromit,fromwhich it determines the obstacle'sposition.

- The parking sensor function can be used when theengine switchis pressed to change the ignition mode to ON, the gearshift lever is in the "R" position and the parking sensor switch is in "ON" position. This function is helpful in the following cases: pulling over to the curb; parallel-parking the vehicle; steering the vehicle into a garage; driving along an alley; and moving slowly in a place with obstacles.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- The parking sensor warns you of obstacles with buzzers and by showing you the location of the obstaclesontheinformationdisplay. However, you must still pay full' attention yourself while driving.
- The sensors can detect obstacles only within a limited area and only when the vehicle is moving within a limited speed range. So, in tricky areas, you must move the vehicle slowly while checking around it using your direct vision or rearview mirrors.There is increased risk of anaccidentifyoucontrol thevehicle relying only on the parking sensor.

## NOTICE

Parking sensors are only for driver's assistance.

## NOTE:

When thegearshift lever is shifted to the "R"position,abuzzerwillsoundonce.

- -The vehicleis ona roughsurface, slope, gravel road or grass field.
- -The vehicle is at a steep angle.

(Continued)

## WARNING

## (Continued)

- Obstacles are too close to the sensors.
- Sensors have intercepted ultrasonic noise from another vehicle's horn, engine, air braking system (large vehicles), or parking sensor.
- Sensors are at an angle to a highly reflective object such as glass (Ultrasonic waves are not reflected back from the obstacle).
- Sensors maynot be able tocorrectly detect the following types of obstacles:
- -Square-shapedcurbstones or other objects with sharp edges.
- Objects made of a thin material like wire netting and ropes.
- Tall objects with a large upper part like a road sign.
- -Low-profile objects such as curbstones.
- Sound-absorbing objects such as cotton and snow.

## Page 349
## NOTE:

- ·Thin poles or obstacles lower than the sensors may becomeundetectable as thevehiclemoves closer to them even if theyhavebeendetectedfromlonger distances.

Upon detecting an obstacle, the parking sensor causes an interior buzzer to sound and a symbol representing the obstacle appears on the information display in the instrument cluster.

- A buzzer located behind the rear seat sounds when a sensor at the rear detects an obstacle.
- Thesystemmaycalculatethedistance to a road sign or similar obstacle to be shorterthantheactualdistance.

## Electronic Stability Program (ESP?

ESP®  is a registered trademark  of Mercedes-Benz Group AG.

The Electronic Stability Program (ESP?) helps to control the vehicle during corneringiffrontwheelsorrearwheelsskid.It also assists you in maintaining traction while accelerating on loose or slippery road surfaces. It does this by regulating the engine's or the hybrid system's output, and by selectively applying the brakes. In addition, ESP? helps to avoid skidding by controlling braking pressure.

## WARNING

The ESP? cannot enhance the vehicle's driving stability in all situations anddoesnot controlyour vehicle's entire braking system. The ESp? cannot prevent taccidents, including thoseresultingfromexcessivespeed in turns, or hydroplaning. Only safe and attentive drive can prevent accidents.

The capabilities of an ESp-equipped vehiclemustneverbeusedasasubstitute for careful driving.
---

## Page 355
The ESP? has the following systems:

## Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)

Refer to"Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)" in this section.

## Brake Assist System

Refer to"Brake Assist System"in this section.

## TractionControlSystem

The traction control system automatically helps prevent the spinning of wheels when thevehicleisstartedoracceleratedon slippery road surfaces. The system operates onlyif it sensesthat some of the wheels are spinning or beginning to lose traction. When this happens, the system operatesthefrontorrearbrakesand reduces the engine power or the hybrid system power to limit wheel spin.

## Stability Control System

Thevehicle stability control system helps provide integrated control of systems such as anti-lock brakes, traction control, engine control, etc. This system automatically controls the brakes and the engine or the hybrid system to help prevent the vehicle from skidding when cornering on a slippery road surface or when turning the steering wheel abruptly.

## WARNING

Always check the surrounding conditionsanddrivethevehicleinasafe manner, as controlling the yehicle by ESPhas limits and Espmay not function properly depending on the surrounding conditions.

## Braking

59RN05770

<!-- image -->

The distance needed to bring any vehicle toahalt increaseswiththespeedof the vehicle. The braking distance needed, for example,at60km/hwillbeapproximately 4 times greater than the braking distance neededat 30km/h.Start todepress the brake pedal when there is plenty of distance between your vehicle and the stopping point, and slow down gradually.

## WARNING

If water gets into the brake devices, brakeperformancemaybecomepoor and  unpredictable. After driving through water or washing the underside of the vehicle,test the brakes while driving at a slow speed to see if theyhavemaintainedtheirnormal effectiveness. If the brakes are less effective than normal,dry them by repeatedly applying the brakes while driving slowly until the brakes have regained their normal effectiveness.

## Power-assisted Brakes

Yourvehiclehaspower-assisted brakes.If power assistance islost due toa stalled engine or other failures, the system is still fully operational on reserve power and you can bring the vehicle to a complete stop by pressing the brake pedal once and holding it down. The reserve power is partly used up when you depress the brake pedal and reduces each time the pedal is pressed. Apply smooth and even pressure to the pedal. Do not pump the pedal.
---

## Page 363
## WARNING

Even without reserve power in the brake system, you can still stop the vehicle by pressing the brake pedal harder than normally required. However, the stopping distance may be longer.

## Brake Assist System

When you slam the brakes on, the brake assist system determines it tobe an emergency stop and provides more powerful brakingfor adriverwhocannotholddown the brake pedal firmly.

## NOTE:

- ·Ifyouquicklyandforcefullydepress the brakes, you may hear clicking sound by thebrake assistsystemoperation.This isnormalandindicatesthatthebrake assist system is activated properly.
- Forthevehiclewiththehybridsystem, operatingsoundfromthebrakesystem maybeheard inthefollowingcasesas well,butitdoesnotindicatethatamalfunctionhasoccurred.

- Motor sound of thebrake system heardfromthefrontpartofthevehicle when thedriver's dooris opened.
- -Operatingsoundheardfrom the enginecompartmentwhenoneortwo minutes passed after the stop of the hybrid system.

## Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)

ABS will help you avoid skidding by electronically controlling braking pressure. It will also help you maintain steering control when braking on slippery surfaces or when braking hard.

The ABS works automatically, so you do not need any special braking technique. Just push the brake pedal down without pumping. The ABS will operate whenever it senses that the wheels are locking up. You may feel the brake pedal move a little while the ABS is operating.

## WARNING

- Always check the surrounding conditions and drive the vehicle in a safe manner, as controlling the vehicle by ABS has limits and the system may not function properly depending on the surrounding conditions.
- If tyre grip performance is over the limit or hydroplaning occurs, ABS cannot workproperly.

## Tyres

## WARNING

ABS detects each wheelrotation speed via a sensor. If tyres or wheels other than those specifiedinthe owner's manualareusedfor size, type, tread pattern, or if worn conditions of tyres are different, the correctwheelrotationspeedcannotbe detected and ABS wili not work properly. This may result in an accident. When replacing tyres, use the tyres with the size, type, and tread patterns which are specified in this owner's manual.

Also, do not use the tyres which are excessively worn.

## Tyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) (if equipped)

The tyre pressure monitoring system is designed to alertyouwhenoneor moreof the tyres on your vehicle is significantly under-inflated. The tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS) sensor containing a unique identification code is mounted on eachwheel.TheTPMSsensors transmit tyre pressure signals to the receiver of the tyre pressure monitoring system controller. When the inflation pressure of one or more tyres indicates significant under-inflation, the low tyre pressure warning light comes on.

## Low Tyre Pressure Warning Light

<!-- image -->

52D305

Each tyre should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressurerecommendedbythevehiclemanufactureronthevehicleplacardortyre pressure label. (If your vehicle has tyres of adifferentsize thanthe size indicatedon the vehicle placard or tyre pressure label, you should determine the proper tyre pressure for those tyres.)

Accordingly, when the low tyre pressure warning light illuminates, you should stop and check your tyres as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure.

As an added fuel efficiency feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates alow tyre pressure warning light when one or more of your tyres is significantly under-inflated.

Driving on a significantly under-inflated tyrecauses the tyre tooverheat andcan leadtotyrefailure.Under-inflationalso reduces fuel efficiency and tyre tread life andmayaffect thevehicle'shandling and stopping ability.
---

## Page 368
## OPERATINGYOURVEHICLE

Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tyre maintenance, and it is the driver's responsibility to maintain correct tyre pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tyre pressure warning light.

WARNING

Relying only on the tyre pressure when it is necessary to add air to the

monitoring system  to  determine tyrescanresult inloss ofcontrolor

an accident.

Check tyre pressures monthly when adjustthemtotherecommended

69RHS180

<!-- image -->

## A CAUTION

<!-- image -->

Donotputthegearshiftleverintothe "N" (Neutral) position while driving, except in times of emergency, as this disengages engine braking, which couldresultinanaccident.

## What Should You Do in Case of Malfunction or Emergency?

- Warning light turns on

Stop immediately in a safe place and take corrective action. For details, refer to "Warning Lights and Indicators" in the "QUICK GUIDE" section or "Warning and indicator messages" in the "INSTRUMENT CLUSTER".

- You feel strong shock from under the floor

Immediately stop in a safe place and checkwhetherthereisbrakefluidleakage or fuel leakage, and also check whetherthereisanyabnormalityinthe exhaust pipe, etc. If any abnormality is found, consult a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.

- Sudden tyre puncture

Grasp the steering wheel firmly, carefully apply the brake, slowly reduce speed, and stop in a safe place.

- You feel that the brake pedal is heavy to use

Via engine vacuum pressure, the vehicle utilizes a brake booster to reduce the force necessary for depressing the brake pedal.If this engine vacuum pressure decreases, you may feel as if the brakes require more force than usual to depress, but this is not abnormal. Depress the brake pedal as strongly as you need to.

·Metallic screeching sound is heard from thebrakes Promptly consult a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.The disk brake pads (MarutiSuzukigenuineparts)are designed to emit a creaking/screeching sound as a function to warn the wear, as they have almost reached usage limit and replacement timing.

## WARNING

The brakes couldbelosing their ability to function normally, which could result inan accident. If you hear a metallic creaking/ screeching sound, do not continue driving.

## When Side Wind Is Strong

72J20330

<!-- image -->

At a tunnel exit, on a bridge, or when a large truck passes you, your vehicle might be blown slightly sideways by side wind. Do not panic. Firmly grasp the steering wheel, gradually reduce speed, and regain your intended course.

## Drive Slowly on a Slippery Road Surface

59RN06030

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

<!-- image -->

When driving on wet, icy, or snowy roads, etc., refrain from sudden movements, such as sudden starting, acceleration, braking, turning or abrupt engine braking. Otherwise, thereisthedangerofanaccidentdue to loss of traction.

## Do not Drive on Puddles at High Speed

69RHS182

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

<!-- image -->

When driving on puddles or on wet road surfaces at high speed, a thin surface of water is built between the wheelsand theroadsurface,and the wheels may float. This is called as hydroplaning, which leads to a loss of control in the steering wheeland the brakes and possibly results in an accident.
---
## Page 381
## CheckBrakeEffectivenessafter Driving on Puddles or Washing a Vehicle

72J20360

<!-- image -->

- ·After verifying the safety of the surroundings，depressthe brake pedalseveral timesatlowspeedandcheckthebrake effectiveness.
- If the brake effectiveness is still poor, depress the brake pedal at low speed gently and repeatedly until the brake effectiveness is fully recovered, to dry the brake equipment.

## When Encountering a Flooded Area

61M0075

<!-- image -->

Avoid driving in a flooded area or a deep puddle. If driving in a flooded area is unavoidable, go slowly in the lowest gear. In case that you have driven in a flooded area, stop the vehicle in a safe and non flooded place while checking the brake effectiveness. Then, ask a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop to check the following inspection items.

- ·Function of brake
- ·Function of electrical components
- Changes of oillevel and quality for engine, transmission and differential. In case that the oil is turbid whitely,water has been mixed in the oil and an oil change is required.
- Lubricant condition of the bearings, suspension joints, etc.

## NOTICE

Avoid driving in a flooded area or a deep puddle. It may cause an engine stall,short in electrical components, engine, hybrid system and transmission damages, etc.
---

## Page 382
## Highway Driving

When driving at highway speeds, pay attention to the following:

- Stopping distance progressively increases with vehicle speed. Apply the brakes far enough ahead of the stopping point to allow for the extra stopping distance.
- On rainy days, hydroplaning can occur. Hydroplaning is the loss of direct contact betweentheroadsurfaceand thevehicle's tyres due to a water film forming between them.Steering or braking the vehicle during hydroplaning can be very difficult, and loss of control can occur. Keep speed down when the road surface is wet.
- ·At high speeds, the vehicle may be affected by side winds. Therefore, reduce speed and be prepared for unexpected buffeting, which can occur at the exits of tunnels, when passing by a cut of a hill, or when being overtaken by large vehicles, etc.

## Driving on Hills Manualtransmissionvehicles

## e-CVTvehicles

76TS60010

<!-- image -->

- When driving on steep hills, the vehicle maybegintoslowdown and showa lack of power. If this happens, you should shift to a lower gear so that the engine or the hybrid system will again be activating in its higher power range. Shift rapidly to prevent the vehicle from losing momentum.
- When driving down a hill, the engine or the hybrid system should be used for braking by shifting to the next lower gear.

## WARNING

## Improving Fuel Economy

## NOTE:

Fuel economy (mileage) of the vehicle may varyduetoseveralfactorsi.e.drivinghabits- gear change pattern, usage of A.C, Air pressure in the tyres, wind speed, traffic conditions, fuel quality-non adulterated standard fuel, maintenance of vehicle, road conditions, braking etc.

The following instructions will help you improve fuel economy.

## KeepTyre Pressures Correct

Under-inflation of the tyres can waste fuel due to increased running resistance of the tyres. Keep your tyres inflated to the correctpressure shown onthe labelon the driver'ssidedooror thedriver'sdoorlock pillar.

## KeepWeightto aMinimum

Theheavier theload is,themorefuel the vehicle consumes. Unload any unnecessary luggage or cargo.

## Avoid Excessive idling

If you park your vehicle for more than one minute, stop the engine or the hybrid system and start it againlater. When warming up a cold engine or the hybrid system, do not allow the engine to idle, the hybrid system to activate or apply full throttle until the engine or thehybrid systemhas reached operating temperature.Allow the engine or the hybrid system to warm up by driving.

## Avoid Fast Starts, Rapid Acceleration and Hard Braking

## Avoidfaststarts

Fast starts away from lights or stop signs will consume fuel unnecessarily and shorten engine or the hybrid system life. Start off slowly.

## Avoid unnecessary stops

Avoid unnecessary deceleration and stopping. Try to maintain a moderate, steady speed whenever possible. Slowing down and then accelerating again uses more fuel.

## Keep a steady cruising speed

Drive at a constant speed that road and traffic conditions will permit.

## Do not Race the Engine

69RHS060

<!-- image -->

Revving the engine only consumes extra fuel and has no benefit.

## NOTICE

Immediately after starting, the engine or thehybridsystemisoftennotyet fully warmed up. Therefore, revving the engine, starting to drive suddenly,  or rapid acceleration can cause engine or the hybrid system failure.
---

## Page 385
## Drive with an Appropriate Gear for VehicleSpeed

Running the vehicle at a high engine rotation speed by using a low-speed gear will result in poor fuel economy. Use the correct gear according to the vehicle speed.

## KeeptheAirCleanerClean

59RN06050

<!-- image -->

If the air cleaner is clogged with dust, there will be greater intake resistance, resulting indecreasedpower outputand increased fuel consumption.

Since special procedures are required, ask a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop for this job.

## StuckVehicle

If your vehicle gets stuck in snow, mud or sand, follow the directions below:

- 1）Shift the transmission back and forth between a"D"(drive）(or first gear for manual  transmission) and reverse. This will create a rocking motion which may give you enoughmomentum to free the vehicle. Press gently on the accelerator to keep wheel spinning to a minimum wheel rpm. Remove your foot from the accelerator while shifting.Do not race the engine or the hybrid system.Excessive wheel spin willcause the tyres to dig deeper, making it more difficulttofreethevehicle.

## NOTE:

You may have to turn the ESP? system off in order to allow spinning the wheels.

- 2) If your vehicle remains stuck after a few minutes of rocking,we recommend you to consult a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop or a roadside assistance service.

## Running-in

## NOTICE

The future performance and reliability of the engine depends on the care andrestraintexercisedduringits earlylife.It isespeciallyimportant to observe the followingprecautions duringthefirst960kmofvehicle operation.

- ·After starting,do not race the engine. Warm it up gradually.
- Start off from a stop slowly. Avoid full throttle starts.
- Avoid prolonged vehicle operation at a constant speed. Moving parts will break inbetter if you varyyour speed.
- Avoid hard braking, especially during the first 320 km of driving.
- Drive the vehicle at moderate engine speeds.
- Do not drive slowly with the transmission in a high gear.
- Do not tow a trailer during the first 960 km of vehicle operation.

## Catalytic Converter

80G106

<!-- image -->

The purpose of the catalytic converter is to minimizetheamountofharmfulpollutants inyourvehicle'sexhaust.Useof leaded fuel in vehicles equipped with catalytic convertersisprohibited，becauselead deactivates the pollutant-reducing components of the catalyst system.

The converter is designed to last the life of thevehicle under normal usage andwhen unleadedfuelisused.Nospecialmaintenanceisrequiredontheconverter.However, it isvery important tokeep the engine properly tuned. Engine misfiring, which can result from an improperly tuned engine, maycauseoverheatingofthecatalytic converter. This may result in permanent heat damage to the catalytic converter and othervehiclecomponents.

## NOTICE

To minimize the possibility of catalyticconverterorothervehicledamage:

- ·Maintain the engine in the proper operating condition.
- In the event of an engine malfunction, particularly one involving engine misfire or other apparent loss of performance,have the vehicleservicedpromptly.
- Do not try to start the engine by pushing or towing the vehicle, or coasting down a hill.
- Do not turn off the engine or interrupt the ignition when the transmission is ingear and the vehicle is in motion.
- Donot idle the engine with any spark plug wires disconnected or removed, such as during diagnostic testing.
- Do not idle the vehicle for prolonged periods if idling seems rough or there are other malfunctions.
- Do not allow the fuel tank to get near the emptylevel.

## Page 391
59RN06060

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Be careful where you park and drive; the catalytic converter and other exhaust components canget very hot. As with any vehicle, do not park oroperatethisvehicleinareaswhere combustible materials such as dry grass or leaves can come in contact with a hot exhaust system.

## When Driving Hybrid Vehicle

For economical and ecological driving, pay attention to the following points:

## Shift lever operation

When using the N, there is no positive effect on fuel consumption.

Shiftthe shift lever toDwhenstopped at a traffic light, or driving in heavy traffic etc. Shift the shift lever to P when parking.

In the N, the gasoline engine operates but electricity cannot be generated.

Also, when using the air conditioning system, etc., the hybrid battery (traction battery) power is consumed.

## Accelerator pedal/brake pedal operation

- Drive your vehicle smoothly. Avoid abrupt acceleration  and  deceleration. Gradualaccelerationanddeceleration willmakemoreeffectiveuseoftheelectric motor (traction motor) without having to use gasoline engine power.
- Avoidrepeatedacceleration.Repeated acceleration  consumes hybrid battery (traction battery) power, resulting in poor fuel consumption. Battery power can be restored by driving with the accelerator pedal slightly released.

## Warming up before driving

Since the gasoline engine starts up and cuts out automatically when cold, warming up the engine is unnecessary. Moreover, frequentlydrivingshortdistanceswill cause the engine to repeatedly warm up, whichcanlead toexcess fuelconsumption.

## Vehicle Loading

Yourvehiclewasdesignedforspecific weight capacities. The weight capacities of yourvehicleareindicatedbytheGross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) and the Permissible maximumAxleWeight(PAW, front and rear). The GVWR and PAW (front and rear）are listed in the"SPECIFICATIONS" section.

GVWR - Maximum permissible overall weight of the fully loaded vehicle (including all the occupants, accessories and cargo plus the trailer nose weight if towing a trailer).

PAW - (Front and Rear) Maximum permissibleweight on an individual axle.

Actualweightoftheloadedvehicleand actualloadsatthefrontandrearaxlescan only be determined by weighing the vehicle. Compare these weights to the GVWR and PAw (front and rear). If the gross vehicleweightortheloadoneitheraxle exceeds these ratings, you must remove enough weight to bring the load down to the rated capacity.

## WARNING

- Never overload your vehicle.The gross vehicle weight (sum of the weights ofthevehicle,all the occupants, accessories, cargo plus trailer nose weight if towing a trailer)must never exceedthe Gross Vehicle WeightRating (GVWR). In addition, never distributealoadsothattheweighton eitherthefrontorrearaxleexceeds thePermissiblemaximumAxle Weight (PAW).
- Alwaysdistributecargoevenly.To avoidpersonalinjuryordamageto your vehicle, always secure cargo toprevent it from shifting if the vehiclemovessuddenly.Place heavier objectsonthefloor andas far forward in the cargo area as possible. Never pile cargo higher than the top of the seat backs.

## Trailer Towing

Your vehicle was originally designed to carry people and a normalamount of cargo, not to tow a trailer.

## INSPECTIONANDMAINTENANCE

It is important to keep the engine oil at the correct level for proper lubrication of your vehicle'sengine.Check theoil level with the vehicle on a level surface. The oil level indication may be inaccurate if the vehicle is on a slope. The oil level should be checked either before starting the engine or hybrid system, or at least 5 minutes after stopping the engine or hybrid system.

Pull out the oil dipstick, wipe the oil off with a clean cloth, insert the dipstick all the way into the engine, and then remove it again. The oil onthe stickshould bebetween the upper and lower limits shown on the stick. If the oil level indication is near the lower limit, add enough oil to raise the level to the upper limit.

## NOTICE

Failure to check the oil level regularly could lead to serious engine trouble due to insufficient oil.

This type of coolant is the best for cooling system for the following reasons:

- ·'The coolant helps maintain proper engine temperature.
- It gives proper protection against freezing and boiling.
- It gives proper protection against corrosion and rust.

Failure to use the proper coolant can damage your cooling system. Your Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop can help you select thepropercoolant.

## NOTICE

## To avoid damaging your cooling system:

- ·Do not use straight coolant nor plain water.
- ·Check that the proper mix is 50/50 coolant to distilied water and in no case higher than 50/50. Concentrationsgreaterthan50/50coolantto distilledwaterwillcauseoverheating conditions.
- ·Do not add extra inhibitors or additives. They may not be compatible with your cooling system.
- Do not mix different types of base coolants. Doing so may result in acceleratedsealwearand/orthe possibility of severe overheating andextensiveengine/automatic transmission damage.

Steering wheel play "c": 0-30mm

Check the free play of the steering wheel by gently turning it from left to right and measuring the distance that it moves before you feel slight resistance. The play should be between the specified values.

Check that thesteeringwheel turnseasily and smoothly without rattling by turning it all the way to the right and to the left while driving very slowly in an open area. If the amount of free play is not as specified or you find anything else to be wrong, an inspection must be performed by a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.

The front and rear tyres pressure specificationsarelistedinthetyreinformation label (1). Both front and rear tyres should have the specified tyre pressure.

Note that the value does not apply to the compact spare tyre, if equipped.

NOTE:

The tyre pressure will change due to changesinatmosphericpressure,temperature or tyre temperature when driving. Toreduce the chance that the low tyre pressurewarninglight(ifequipped)will come on due to normal changes in temperatureandatmosphericpressure,itis importanttocheckandadjustthetyre pressureswhen the tyres are cold.Ifyou check tyres after driving,they are warm. Even if thetyrepressureseems tobegood inthiscondition，itcouldfallbelowthe specified pressure when tyres cool down. Also, tyres that are inflated to the specified pressurein a warmgaragemayhavepressurebelowthespecificationwhenthevehicle is driven outside  in verycold temperature. If you adjust the tyre pressureinagaragethatiswarmer thanthe outside temperature, you should add 1 kPa to the recommended cold tyre pressure for every 0.8 °C difference between garage temperature andoutsidetemperature.

## Tyre Inspection

Inspectyourvehicle'styresatleastoncea month or before long trip by performing the following checks:

- 1) Measure the air pressure with a tyre gauge. Adjust the pressure if necessary.

## WARNING

- Air pressures should be checked when the tyres are cold or you may getinaccuratereadings.
- Check the tyre pressure from time to time while inflating the tyre gradually, until the specified pressure is obtained.
- Never under-inflate or over-inflate
- the tyres. Under-inflationcancauseunusual handling characteristics or can cause the rim to slip on the tyre bead,resulting in an accident or damagetothe tyre orrim. Over-inflationcancause thetyre to burst, resulting in personal injury. Over-inflationcanalso cause unusual handling  characteristics which may result in an accident.

## WARNING

- ·Your Maruti Suzuki vehicleis equipped with tyres which are all the same type and size. This is important to ensure proper steering and handling of the vehicle. Never mix tyres ofdifferentsizeortype onthefourwheelsofyourvehicle. The size and type of tyres used should be only those approved by Maruti Suzuki as standard or optional equipment for your vehicle.

(Continued)

## WARNING

## (Continued)

- Therefore, use only those wheel and tyre combinations approved by Maruti Suzuki as standard or optional equipment for your vehicle.
- ·Replacing the wheels and tyres equippedonyourvehiclewithcertaincombinationsofaftermarket wheels and tyres can significantly change the steering and handling characteristics of your vehicle.

## NOTICE

- Replacing the original tyres with tyres of a different size may result infalsespeedometer or odometer readings.CheckwithaMaruti Suzukiauthorizedworkshopbefore purchasing replacement tyres that differ in size from the original tyres.

55T090680

To avoid uneven wear of your tyres and to prolong their life, rotate the tyres as illustrated. Tyres should be rotated every 10000 km. After rotation, adjust front and rear tyre pressures to the specification listed on your vehicle's Tyre Information Label.

## Wheel Balancing

Ifthe vehicle vibrates abnormally on smooth road, have the wheel balanced at a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.

## Wheel Alignment

In case of abnormal tyre wear or pulling towards one side,have the wheel aligned at a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop.

## Tubeless Tyres

The vehicle is equipped with Tubeless Tyres. In tubeless tyre, a thin layer of butyl rubber is used for lining the inside of the tubeless tyre. This layer is to prevent air loss and fulfilling the purpose of tube. The air pressure is maintained by the sealing between tyre bead and wheel rim. Tubeless tyres are having advantage of slow air loss and preventing sudden deflation while driving.

## Care and maintenance tips for tubeless tyres

- 2) In case any leakage is found, check for any nail penetration/valve core damage or rim bent. Damaged wheel must not be used.
- 1) Always maintain recommended inflation pressure. Driving continuously at low inflation pressure can lead to tyre damage.
- 3) In case tyre has run at low pressure, it must be inspected for any defect.
- 4) Whenever new tyre is fitted, replace the valve.
- 5) If continuous high speed driving is required, increase tyres pressure by 5 psi over recommended inflation pressure.
- 6) Never run the tyre beyond TWl (Tread wearindicator).Thetyreisrecommended to be replaced when the remaining tread has worn to this point. The indicators are spaced across the tread around the tyre marked by a triangular symbol (TWl).
7. 7 Always prefer tubeless tyre mounting machine. In case of manual mountingtyre/wheel rim damage mayoccur.
- 8) In case of any problem, please get in touchwithaMarutiSuzukiauthorized workshop.
