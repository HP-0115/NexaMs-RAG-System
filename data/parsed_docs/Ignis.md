## WARNING

NEVER use a rearward facing child restraint on a seat protected by an ACTIVEAIRBAGinfrontofit,DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the CHILD can occur.

## Front air bags

68PH00247

<!-- image -->

Front air bags are designed to inflate in severe frontal crashes when the ignition switch is in "ON" position or the ignition mode is ON.

Front air bags are not designed to inflate in rear impacts, side impacts, rollovers or minor frontal crashes, since they would offer no protection in those types of accidents. Since an air bag deploys only one time during an accident, seat belts are needed torestrain occupantsfromfurther movements during the accident.

Therefore, an air bag is not a substitute for seat belts. To maximize your protection, always fasten your seat belts. Be aware that no system can prevent all possible injuries that may occur in an accident.

## Front airbags may not inflate

The front airbags may not inflate when a strong impact has not occurred since the collision object (including living being like animals) was easy to be deformed or moved, or the collided portion of your vehicle was easy to be deformed.

Also, front airbags may not inflate in many cases when the collision angle is greater than about 30 degrees at left and right angles from the front of your vehicle.

Also, in certain collisions at low speed, the air bags may not inflate.

80J102

## How the system works

In a frontal crash, the crash sensors will detectrapiddeceleration,andifthecontroller judges that the deceleration represents a severe frontal crash，the controller will trigger the inflators. The inflators inflate the appropriate air bags with nitrogen or argon gas. The inflated air bags provide a cushion for your head and upperbody.Theairbaginflatesand deflatessoquicklythatyoumaynoteven realize that it has activated. The air bag will neither hinder your view nor make it harder to exit the vehicle.

Air bags must inflate quickly and forcefully inordertoreducethechanceofseriousor fatal injuries. However, an unavoidable consequence of thequick inflationis that the air bag may irritate bare skin, such as the facial area against a front air bag. Also, upon inflation, a loud noise will occur and somepowderandsmokewillbereleased. These conditions are not harmful and do not indicate a fire in the vehicle. Be aware, however, that some air bag components maybehotforawhileafterinflation.

A seat belt helps keep you in the proper position for maximum protection when an air bag inflates. Adjust your seat as far back as possible while still maintaining control of the vehicle. Sit fully back in your seat;situpstraight;donot leanover the steeringwheelordashboard.Frontoccupantsshouldnotleanonorsleepagainst the door.Refer to"Seat adjustment"section and "Seat belts and child restraint systems"sectioninthis sectionfor details on proper seat and seat belt adjustments.

## Page 63
## Servicing the air bag system

If the air bags inflate, have the air bags and related components replaced by a MarutiSuzukiauthorisedworkshopas soon as possible.

Ifyourvehicleevergetsindeepwaterand the driver's floor is submerged, the air bag controller could be damaged. If this happens,ask Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop to check the air bag system as soon aspossible.

Special procedures are required for servicing or replacing an air bag. For that reason，onlya MarutiSuzukiauthorised workshopshouldbeallowedtoserviceor replaceyour air bags. Remind anyonewho services your vehicle that it has air bags.

Service on or around air bag components or wiring must be performed only by a Maruti  Suzuki  authorised    workshop. Improperservicecouldresultinunintended air bag deployment or could render the air bag inoperative. Either of these two conditions may result in severe injury.

To prevent damage or unintended inflation of the air bag system, make sure that the batteryisdisconnectedandtheignition switchhasbeenin"LOCK"positionor the ignition mode has been LOCK (OFF) for at least 90 seconds before performing any electrical service work on your vehicle. Do not touch air bag system components or wires. The wires are wrapped with yellow tape or yellow tubing, and the couplers are yellow for easy identification.

Scrapping a vehicle that has an uninflated air bag can be hazardous. Ask your dealer, body repair shop or scrap yard for help withdisposal.

## Warning and indicator lights

NOTE:

Ifwarningandindicator lightsblink or come on, the corresponding messages may be shown on the information display.

## Brake system warning light

<!-- image -->

Three different types of operations exist depending on the vehicle's specification.

- ·The light comes on briefly when the ignition switch is turned to "ON" position or the engine switch is pressed to change the ignition mode to ON.
- The light comes on when the parking brake is engaged with the ignition switch in "ON" position or the ignition mode is ON.
- The light comes on under either or both of above two conditions.

The light also comes on when the fluid in the brake fluid reservoir falls below the specified level.

The light should go out after starting the engine and fully releasing the parking brake, if the fluid level in the brake fluid reservoirisadequate.

The light also comes on together with the ABS warning light when the rear brake force control function (proportioning valve function) of the ABS system fails.

If the brake system warning light comes on while you are driving the vehicle, it may mean that there is something wrong with the vehicle's brake system. If this happens:

- 1) Pull off the road and stop carefully.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Remember that stopping distance may be longer, you may have to push harder on the pedal, and the pedal may go down farther than normal.

- 2） Test the brakes by carefully starting and stopping the vehicle on the shoulder of the road.
- 3) If you determine that it is safe, drive the vehiclecautiouslyatlowspeedtothe nearestdealerforrepairsortowthe vehicle to the nearest dealer for repairs.

## WARNING

Ifanyof the followingconditions occur, you should immediately ask your Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop to inspect the brake system.

- ·If the brake system warning light does not go out after the engine has been started and the parking brakehasbeenfullyreleased.
- If the brake system warning glight does not come on when the ignition switch is turned to "ON" position or the engine switch is pressed to change the ignition mode to ON.
- If the brake system warning light comes on at any time during vehicle operation.

## Page 105
## Engine oil consumption

It is normal for the engine to consume some engine oil during normal vehicle operation.

Theamountofengineoilconsumption depends on viscosity and quality of the oil and your driving conditions.

A new engine also consumes more oil, since its pistons, piston rings and cylinder walls have not yet become conditioned. New engines reach the normal level of oil consumptiononlyafter approximately 5000 km driving.

More oil is consumed during high-speed driving and when there is frequent acceleration and deceleration.Under high loads, your engine also will consume more oil.

## Oil consumption: Max. 1.0 L per 1000 km

When judging the amount of oil consumption, note that the oil may become diluted anditisdifficulttojudge the accurateoil level.

As an example, if a vehicle is used for repeatedshorttrips,andconsumesanormal amount of oil,the dipstick may not show any drop in the oil level at all, even after 1000 km or more of driving. This is because the oil gradually becomes diluted withfuel ormoisture,making it appearthat the oil level has not changed.

Youshouldalsobeawarethatthediluting ingredientsevaporateoutwhenthevehicle is subsequentlydriven at highspeeds such as on an expressway, making it appear that oil is excessively consumed after high-speed driving.

## Clutch pedal (1)

A clutch pedal is used to disengage the drive to the wheels when starting the engine, stopping, or shifting the gearshift lever. Depressing the pedal disengages the clutch.

## WARNING

Do not drive with your foot resting on the clutch pedal.It could result in excessive clutch wear, clutch damage, or unexpected loss of engine braking.

## Brake pedal (2)

Your MARUTI SUZUKI vehicle is equipped with front disc brakes and rear drum brakes. Depressing a brake pedal applies both sets of brakes.

You may hear occasional brake squeal when you apply the brakes. This is a normalconditioncausedbyenvironmental factors such as temperature, humidity, snow or dust,etc.

## WARNING

If brake squeal is excessive and occurs each time the brakes are applied,you should have the brakes checked by your Maruti Suzuki authorisedworkshop.

## WARNING

Do not apply brakes continuously or rest your foot on the brake pedal. Thiswillresultinoverheatingofthe brakes which could cause unpredictable braking action, longer stopping distances, or permanent brake damage.

Whenthegearshiftleverisinaposition other than "N" (Neutral), the gearshift indicatorisindicatedontheinformationdisplay when the ignition switch is in "ON" position or theignition modeis ON.

The electronic control system monitors driving condition(such as vehicle speed and/or engine revolution), and it shows which gear position is optimal for your driving with the indication on the display.

IfUP/DOWNarrowisindicatedonthedisplay while driving, we recommend you to shift up or down the gear until the arrow disappears. It is the optimal gear position for a driving condition that reduces the over revolution and stress to the engine, and improves fuel consumption.

For details on how to use the transaxle, refer to"Using transaxle"in this section.

## Parking sensors

- The parking sensor system uses ultrasonicsensorstodetectobstaclesnear therearbumper.Ifobstaclesaresensed while you are parking or moving the vehicle slowly, the system warns you by sounding a buzzer.
- The system emits an ultrasonic wave and therelevantsensordetects the return of the wave reflected by an obstacle. The system measures the time takenbytheultrasonicwavetoreachthe obstacleandreturnfromit,fromwhich it determines the obstacle's position.
- The parking sensor function can be used when you press the engine switch to change the ignition mode to "ON", the gearshift lever is in the "R" position. This function is helpful in the following cases: pulling over to the curb; parallel parking the vehicle; steering the vehicle into a garage; driving along an alley; and moving slowly in a place with obstacles.

## WARNING

- The parking sensor warns you of obstacles with buzzers. However, you still have to drive with particular care.
- The sensors can detect obstacles only within a limited area and only when thevehicle is moving within a limitedspeedrange.So,intricky areas,youmustmovethevehicle slowlywhilecheckingaroundit usingyourdirectvisionorrearview mirrors.There is increased risk of an accident ifyoucontrol thevehicle relying only on the parking sensor.

## NOTE:

- ·When the gearshift leveris shifted to"R" position,buzzerwill sound once.

## Braking

60G165S

<!-- image -->

The distance needed to bring any vehicle to a halt increases with the speed of the vehicle. The braking distance needed, for example,at60km/hwillbeapproximately 4 times greater than thebraking distance neededat 30km/h.Start todepress the brake pedal when there is plenty of distance betweenyour vehicle and the stopping point, and slow down gradually.

## WARNING

If water gets into the brake devices, brake performance may become poor and  unpredictable.  After driving through water or washing the undersideofthevehicle,testthebrakes while driving at a slow speed to see if theyhave maintained their normal effectiveness.Ifthebrakesareless effective than normal,dry them by repeatedlyapplyingthebrakeswhile driving slowlyuntil the brakes have regained their normal effectiveness.

## Power-assistedbrakes

Your vehicle has power-assisted brakes. If power assistance is lost due to a stalled engineorotherfailures,thesystemis still fully operational on reserve power and you canbringthevehicletoacompletestopby pressing the brake pedal once and holding it down.The reserve power is partlyused upwhenyoudepress thebrakepedaland reduces eachtime the pedalispressed. Apply smooth and even pressure to the pedal. Do not pump the pedal.

## WARNING

Even without reserve power in the brake system, you can still stop the vehicle by pressing the brake pedal harder than normally required. However, the stopping distance may be longer.

## Brake assist system

When you slam the brakes on, the brake assistsystem determinesittobe anemergency stop and provides more powerful brakingforadriverwhocannotholddown the brake pedal firmly.

## NOTE:

Ifyou quickly and forcefully depress the brakes, you may hear clicking sound by the brake assist system operation. This is normalandindicatesthatthebrakeassist system is activated properly.

## Anti-lock brake system (ABS)

The ABS works automatically, so you do not needany specialbraking technique. Justpushthebrakepedaldownwithout pumping. The ABS will operate whenever it senses that the wheels are locking up. You may feel the brake pedal move a little while the ABS is operating.

ABSwillhelpyou avoid skiddingbyelectronically controlling braking pressure. It will also help you maintain steering control when braking on slippery surfaces or when braking hard.

## OPERATINGYOURVEHICLE

## NOTE:

- ·If theABSsystem isactivated,you may hear a clunking noise and/or feel pulsatinginthe brake pedal.This is normal andindicatesthatthebrakefluidpressureisbeingcontrolledproperly.

## WARNING

- On some types of loose surfaces (suchas gravel,  snow-covered roads,etc.),the stopping distance requiredforavehiclewithABS may be slightly greater than the onerequiredforacomparablevehiclewithaconventionalbrakesystem.Withaconventionalbrake system, skidding tires are able to plow the gravel or snow layer, shortening the stopping distance. ABSminimizesthisresistance effect. Allow for extra stopping distance whendriving onloosesurfaces.

## WARNING

(Continued)

- On regular paved roads, some drivers may be able to obtain slightly shorter stopping distances with conventional brake systems than with ABS.
- In both of the above conditions, ABSwillstilloffertheadvantageof helping you maintain directional control. However, remember that ABS will not compensate for bad roadorweatherconditionsorpoor driver judgment. Use good judgment and do not drive too fast.

## HowABSworks

A computer continuouslymonitors wheel speed. The computer compares  the changes in wheel speed when braking. If the wheels slow suddenly,indicating a skidding situation，the computer will change braking pressure several times each second to prevent the wheels from locking.Whenyoustartyourvehicle or when you accelerate after a hard stop, you mayhear amomentarymotoror clicking noise asthe systemresets or checks itself.

## WARNING

The ABS may not work properly if tiresorwheelsotherthanthose specified in the owner's manual are used.ThisisbecausetheABSworks by comparing changes in wheel speed. When replacing tires or wheels, use only the size and type specified in this owner's manual.

## Electronic stability program (ESP?) (if equipped)

ESP? is a registered trademark of Daimler AG.

The Electronic Stability Program (ESP?) helpstocontrol thevehicle duringcornering if front wheels or rear wheels skid. It also assists you in maintaining traction while accelerating on loose or slippery road surfaces.It does this by regulating the engine's output, and by selectively applying the brakes. In addition, ESP? helps to avoid skidding by controlling braking pressure.

## WARNING

The Esp? cannot enhance the vehicle'sdrivingstabilityinallsituations and does not control your vehicle's entire braking system. The Esp? cannot prevent accidents, including thoseresultingfromexcessivespeed in turns, or hydroplaning. Only safe and attentive drive can prevent accidents.

The capabilities of an ESp-equipped vehiclemustneverbeusedasasubstitute for careful driving.

The ESP? has the following systems:

## Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)

Refer to"Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)" in this section.

## BrakeAssistSystem

## Traction Control System

Thetractioncontrolsystemautomatically helps prevent the spinning of wheels when thevehicleisstartedoracceleratedon slippery road surfaces. The system operatesonlyif itsensesthatsomeof the wheels are spinning\_ or beginning to lose traction. When this happens, the system operates the front or rear brakes and reduces engine power to limit wheel spin.

- Neverdriveundertheinfluenceof alcohol or other drugs. Alcohol and drugs can seriouslyimpair your ability  to drive safely, greatly increasing therisk ofinjuryto yourself and others. You should alsoavoiddrivingwhenyouare tired, sick, irritated or under stress.

## Running-in

## NOTICE

The future performance and reliability of the engine depends on the care and restraint exercised during its earlylife.Itisespeciallyimportantto observe the following precautions during the first 960 kmof vehicle operation.

- ·'After starting, do not race the engine. Warm it up gradually.
- ·Avoidprolongedvehicleoperation at a constant speed. Moving parts will break in better if you vary your speed.
- Start off from a stop slowly. Avoid full throttle starts.
- Do not drive slowly with the transaxle in a high gear.
- Avoid hard braking, especially during the first 320 km of driving.
- ·Drivethe vehicleatmoderate engine speeds.
- Do not tow a trailer.

## Catalytic converter

<!-- image -->

80G106

The purpose of the catalytic converter is to minimizetheamountofharmfulpollutants inyour vehicle'sexhaust.Useof leaded fuel in vehicles equipped with catalytic converters isprohibited，becauselead deactivatesthepollutant-reducingcomponents of the catalyst system.

The converter is designed tolast the life of the vehicle under normal usage and when unleaded fuel is used. No special maintenance is required on theconverter.However, it is very important to keep the engine properly tuned. Engine misfiring, which can result from animproperly tuned engine may cause overheating of the catalytic converter.This may result in permanent heat damage to the catalytic converter and othervehiclecomponents.
---

## Page 144
## NOTICE

To minimize the possibility of catalyticconverterorothervehicledamage:

- Maintain the engine in the proper operating condition.
- In the event of an engine malfunction, particularly one involving engine misfire or other apparent loss of performance,have the vehicle serviced promptly.
- Do not try to start the engine by pushing or towing the vehicle, or coasting down a hill.
- Donotturnofftheengineorinterrupt the ignition when the transaxle is in gear and the vehicle is in motion.
- Do not idle the engine with any spark plug wires disconnected or removed, such as during diagnostic testing.
- Do not allow the fuel tank to get near theemptylevel.
- Do not idle the vehicle for prolonged periods if idling seems roughorthereareothermalfunctions.

## WARNING

Be careful where you park and drive; the catalytic converter and other exhaust components canget very hot. As with any vehicle, do not park or operate this vehicle in areas where combustible materials such as dry grassorleavescancomeincontact with a hot exhaust system.

## Improving fuel economy

## NOTE:

Fuel economy(mileage)ofthevehiclemay vary duetoseveralfactorsi.e.,driving habits - gear change pattern, usage of A.C, Air pressure in the tyres, wind speed, trafficconditions,fuelquality-nonadulterated standard fuel，maintenance of vehicle, road conditions,braking etc.

The following instructions will help you improve fuel economy.

## Avoid excessiveidling

Ifyouaretowaitformorethanaminute while you are parked, stop the engine and start itagainlater.Whenwarmingupa coldengine,donotallowtheenginetoidle or apply full throttle until the engine has reached operating temperature. Allow the engine to warm up by driving.

## Avoidsuddenacceleration

Sudden acceleration starting from rest or whiledrivingwillconsumefuelunnecessarily and shorten engine life. Start off slowly.

## Avoid unnecessary stops

Avoid unnecessary deceleration and stopping. Try to maintain a slow, steady speed whenever possible. Slowing down and then accelerating again uses more fuel.

## Keep a steady cruising speed

Drive at a constant speed that road and traffic conditions will permit.

60A183S

If theaircleaneriscloggedwithdust,there will be greater intake resistance, resulting in decreased power output and increased fuel consumption.

## Keep weight to a minimum

Theheavier theloadis,themorefuelthe vehicle consumes. Unload any unnecessary luggage or cargo.

## Keep tire pressures correct

Under-inflation of the tires can waste fuel due to increased runningresistance of the tires. Keep your tires inflated to the correct pressureshownon thelabel onthedriver's sidedoororthedriver'sdoorlockpillar.

## Highway driving

- Stopping distance progressively increases with vehicle speed. Apply the brakes far enough ahead of the stopping point to allow for the extra stopping distance.

When driving at highway speeds, pay attention to the following:

- On rainy days, hydroplaning can occur. Hydroplaning is the loss of direct contact betweentheroadsurfaceand thevehicle's tires due to a water film forming betweenthem.Steeringorbrakingthe vehicle during hydroplaning can be very difficult,and loss of control can occur. Keep speed down when the road surface is wet.
- At high speeds, the vehicle may be affected dby side winds.  Therefore, reduce speed and be prepared for unexpected buffeting, which can occur at the exits of tunnels, when passing by a cut of a hill, or when being overtaken by large vehicles, etc.

## Driving on hills

## Page 146
- When climbing steep hills, the vehicle may begin to slow down and show a lack of power. If this happens, you should shift to a lower gear so that the engine willagain be operating in its normal power range. Shift rapidly to prevent the vehicle from losing momentum.
- When driving down a hill, the engine should be used for braking by shifting to the next lower gear.

## While moving uphill/gradient from a standstillcondition

- Apply the parking brake firmly so that the vehicledoesnotrollbackwards.
- ·Depress the Clutch pedal and Shift the gearshift lever to 1st Select position.
- Donotsliptheclutch.
- ·When ready to start, press accelerator pedalandslowlyrelease the clutch pedal simultaneously. When the vehicle starts to move, gradually release the parking brake.

## WARNING

Do not hold the brake pedal down too long or too often while going down a steep or long hill. This could cause the brakes to overheat,resulting in reducedbrakingefficiency.Failure to takethisprecautioncouldresultin lossofvehiclecontrol.

## NOTICE

When descending a downhill, Never turn theignitionkey to"LOCK"position or press the engine switch to change the ignition mode to LocK (OFF). Emission control system damage may result.

## Driving on slippery roads

66RM04002

<!-- image -->

On wet roads, you should drive at a lower speed than you do on dry roads due to possible slippage of tires during braking. When driving on icy, snow-covered or muddy roads, reduce your speed and avoid sudden acceleration, abrupt braking, or sharp steering movements.

## VEHICLELOADINGANDTOWING

## Vehicle loading

Your vehicle was designed for specific weight capacities.Theweight capacities of your vehicle are indicated by the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR）and the Permissible maximum Axle Weight (PAW, frontand rear).TheGVWR andPAW(front and rear）are listed in the "SPECIFICATIONS"section.

GVWR - Maximum permissible overall weight of the fully loaded vehicle (including all the occupants, accessories and cargo plus the trailer nose weight if towing a trailer).

PAW (front and rear)- Maximum permissible weight on an individual axle.

Actualweightoftheloadedvehicleand actual loadsatthefrontandrearaxlescan only be determined by weighing the vehicle.Compare these weights to the GVWR and PAW (front and rear). If the gross vehicle weight or theload on either axle exceeds these ratings, you must remove enough weight to bring the load down to the rated capacity.

## WARNING

Never overload your vehicle. The gross vehicle weight (sum of the weights of the vehicle, all the occupants, accessories, cargo plus trailer nose weight if towing a trailer) must neverexceedtheGrossVehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). In addition, neverdistributealoadsothatthe weight on either the frontorrear axle exceeds the Permissible maximum Axle Weight (PAW).

## WARNING

Always distribute cargo evenly. To avoid personal injury or damage to your vehicle, always secure cargo to prevent it from shifting if the vehicle movessuddenly.Placeheavier objects on the floor and as far forward in the cargo area as possible. Never pile cargo higher than the top oftheseatbacks.
