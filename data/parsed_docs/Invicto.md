## Main Owner's Manual

Please note that this manual appliestoall models andexplains all equipment, including options. Therefore, you may find some explanationsfor equipment not installed on your vehicle.

All specifications provided in this manual are current at the time of printing. However, because of the Maruti Suzuki policy of continual product improvement, we reserve the right to make changes at any time without notice.

Depending on specifications, the vehicle shown in the illustrations may differ from your vehicle in terms of equipment.

## Accessories, spare parts and modification of your vehicle

A wide variety of non-genuine spare parts and accessories for Maruti Suzuki vehicles are currently available in the market. Using these spare parts and accessories which are not genuine Maruti Suzuki products may adversely affect the safety of your vehicle, even though these parts may be approved by certain authorities in your country. MARUTISUZUKIINDIALIMITED therefore cannot accept any liability or guarantee spare parts and accessories which are not genuine Maruti Suzuki products, nor for replacement or installation involving such parts.

Thisvehicle should not bemodified with non-genuine Maruti Suzuki products. Modification with non-
---

## Page 18
genuine Maruti Suzuki products could affect its performance, safety or durability,and may evenviolate governmental regulations. In addition, damage or performance problems resulting from the modification may not be covered under warranty.

## Cyber Attack Risk

Installing electronic devices and radios increases the risk of cyber attacks through the installed parts, which may lead to unexpected accidents and leakage of personal information. Maruti Suzuki does not make any guarantees for problems caused by installing non-genuine Maruti Suzukiproducts.

## Installation of an RF-transmitter system

The installation of an RF-transmitter system in yourvehicle could affect electronic systems such as:

- Hybrid system
- Multiport fuel injection system/sequential multiport fuel injection system
- Anti-lock brake system
- SRS airbag system
- Seat belt pretensioner system

Be sure to check with your Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop for precautionary measures or special instructions regarding installation of an RF-transmitter system.

Further information regarding frequency bands, power levels, antenna positions and installation provisions for the installation of RFtransmitters, is available on request at your Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

High voltage parts and cables on the Hybrid Electric Vehicles emit approximately the same amount of electromagnetic waves as the conventional gasoline powered vehicles or home electronic appliances despite of their electromagnetic shielding.

Unwanted noise may occur in the reception of the radio frequency transmitter (RF-transmitter).

## Vehicle data recording

The vehicle is equipped with sophisticated computers that will record certain data, such as:

- Engine speed/Electric motor speed (traction motor speed)
- Accelerator status
- Brake status
- Vehicle speed
- Operation status of the driving assist systems

The recorded data varies according to the vehicle grade level, options and destinations with which it is equipped.

- Data usage

MarutiSuzukimayuse the data

## Page 19
recorded in this computer to diagnose malfunctions, conduct research and development, and improve quality. Maruti Suzuki will not disclose the recorded data to a third party except:

- ·Withtheconsentofthevehicleowner orwiththeconsentofthelesseeif thevehicleisleased
- In response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a government agency
- ·For use by Maruti Suzuki in a lawsuit
- ·For research purposes where the data is not tied to a specific vehicle or vehicleowner

## Usage of data collected through Suzuki Connect

If your vehiclehas Suzuki Connect and if you have subscribed to those services, please refer to the Suzuki Connect usage contract for information ondata collected and its usage. For more information, visit https://www.marutisuzuki.com/ corporate/technology/suzukiconnect

## Event data recorder

This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-likesituations,suchasan airbag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understandinghowavehicle'ssystems performed. The EDR is designed to record datarelated to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. However, data may not be recorded depending on the severity and type of a crash.

The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:

- How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
- ●How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,
- Howfast thevehiclewas traveling.

These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstancesinwhichcrashesand injuries occur.

NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crashsituation occurs;no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation.

To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such
---

## Page 20
as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR.

●Disclosure of the EDR data Maruti Suzuki will not disclose the data recorded in an EDR to a third party except when:

- ·An agreement from the vehicle's owner (or the lessee for a leased vehicle) is obtained
- In response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a government agency
- ·For use by Maruti Suzuki in a lawsuit However, if necessary, Maruti Suzuki may:
- ·Use the data for research on vehicle safety performance
- ·Disclose the data to a third party for research purposes without disclosing information about the specific vehicleorvehicleowner

## Scrapping of your vehicle

The SRS airbag and seat belt pretensioner devices in your vehicle contain explosive chemicals. If the vehicle is scrapped with the airbags and seat belt pretensioners left as they are, this may cause an accident such as fire. Be sure to have the systems of the SRS airbag and seat belt pretensioner removed and disposed of by a qualified service shop or by your Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop before you scrap your vehicle.

## WARNING

## SRS airbag precautions

Observe the following precautions. Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.

- The driver and all passengers must wear their seat belts correctly. The SRS airbags are supplemental devicestobeusedwiththeseat belts.
- The SRS driver airbag deploys with considerableforce,and cancause death or serious injury, especially if the driver is very close to the airbag.

Since the risk zone for the driver's airbag is the first 50 - 75 mm (2 - 3 in.) of inflation, placing yourself 250 mm (10 in.) from your driver airbag provides you with a clear margin of safety. This distanceismeasuredfromthecenter of the steering wheel to your breastbone. If your current driving position places you less than 250 mm (10 in.) away from the driver airbag, you can change your driving position in several ways:

- Move your seat to the rear asfar as possible while still being able to reach the pedals comfortably.
- Slightly recline the seatback. Although vehicle designs vary, many drivers can achieve the 250 mm (10 in.) distance, even with the driver seat all the way forward, simply by reclining the seatback somewhat. If reclining the seatback makesithardtoseetheroad,raise yourself by using a firm, non-slippery cushion, or raise the seat if your vehicle has that feature.
- Ifyoursteeringwheelisadjustable, tilt it downward.Thispointsthe airbag toward your chest instead of your head and neck.

Theseatshouldbeadjustedasrecommended above, while still being abletocontrolthevehiclewiththe pedalsandsteeringwheel,andmaintaining your view of the instrument panel controls.

## Hybrid Electric Vehicle driving tips

For economical and ecological driving, pay attention to the following points:

## Using Eco drive mode

When using Eco drive mode, the torque corresponding to the accelerator pedal depression amount can be generated more smoothly than it is in normal conditions. In addition, the operation of the air conditioning system (heating/cooling) will be minimized, improving the fuel economy. (→&gt;P.196)

## Use of Hybrid System Indicator

The Eco-friendly driving is possible by keeping the indicate of Hybrid System Indicator withinEco area. (→P.86)

## Shift lever operation

Shift the shift lever to D when stopped at a traffic light, or driving in heavy traffic etc. Shift the shift lever to P when parking. When using the N, there is no positive effect on fuel consumption. In the N, the gasoline engine operates but electricity cannot be generated. Also, when using the air conditioning system, etc., the hybrid battery

(traction battery) power is consumed.

## Accelerator pedal/brake pedal operation

- Drive your vehicle smoothly. Avoid abrupt acceleration and deceleration.Gradual acceleration and decelerationwill make more effective use of the electric motor (traction motor) without having to use gasoline engine power.
- Avoidrepeated acceleration. Repeated acceleration consumes hybrid battery (traction battery) power, resulting in poor fuel consumption. Battery power can be restored by driving with the accelerator pedal slightly released.

## When braking

Make sure to operate the brakes gently and in a timely manner. A greater amount of electrical energy can be regenerated when slowing down.

## Delays

Repeated acceleration and deceleration, as well as long waits at traffic lights, will lead to bad fuel economy. Check traffic reports before leaving and avoid delays as much as possible. When driving in
---

## Page 212
a traffic jam, gently release the brake pedal to allow the vehicle to move forward slightly while avoiding overuse of the accelerator pedal. Doing so can help control excessive gasoline consumption.

## Highway driving

Control and maintain the vehicle at a constant speed. Before stopping at a toll booth or similar, allow plenty of time to release the accelerator and gently apply the brakes. A greater amount of electrical energy can be regenerated when slowing down.

## Air conditioning

Use the air conditioning only when necessary. Doing so can help reduce excessive gasoline consumption.

In summer: When the ambient temperature is high, use the recirculated air mode. Doing so will help to reduce the burden on the air conditioning system and reduce fuel consumption as well.

In winter: Because the gasoline engine will not automatically cut out until it and the interior of the vehicle are warm, it will consume fuel. Also, fuel consumption can be improved by avoidingoveruse of theheater.

## Checking tire inflation pressure

Make sure to check the tire inflation pressure frequently. Improper tire inflation pressure can cause poor fuel economy.

Also, as snow tires can cause large amounts of friction, their use on dry roads can lead to poor fuel economy. Use tires that are appropriate for the season.

## Luggage

Carrying heavy luggage will lead to poor fuel economy. Avoid carrying unnecessary luggage. Installing a large roof rack will also cause poor fuel economy.

## Warming up before driving

Since the gasoline engine starts up and cuts out automatically when cold, warming up the engine is unnecessary. Moreover, frequently driving short distances will cause the engine to repeatedly warm up, which can lead to excess fuel consumption.
---

## Page 213
## Winter driving tips

Carry out the necessary preparations and inspections before driving the vehicle in winter. Always drive the vehicle in a manner appropriate to the prevailing weather conditions.

## Preparation for winter

- Use fluids that are appropriate to the prevailing outside temperatures.
- ·Engine oil
- ·Engine coolant
- ·Power control unit coolant
- ·Washer fluid
- Have a service technician inspect the condition of the 12volt battery.
- Have the vehicle fitted with four snow tires or purchase a set of tire chains for the front tires.

Ensure that all tires are the same size andbrand,and thatchainsmatchthe size ofthetires.

## NOTICE

- IRepairingor replacing snowtires (vehicles with tire pressure warning system)

Request repairs or replacement of snowtiresfromyourMarutiSuzuki authorised workshop or legitimate tire retailers.

Thisisbecausetheremovaland attachment of snow tires affects the operation of the tire pressure warning valvesandtransmitters.

## Before driving the vehicle

Perform the following according to the driving conditions:
---

## Page 214
- Do not try to forcibly open a window or move a wiper that is frozen.Pour warmwater over the frozen area to melt the ice. Wipe away the water immediately to prevent it from freezing.
- ●To ensure proper operation of the climate control system fan, remove any snow that has accumulated on the air inlet vents in frontofthewindshield.
- Check for and remove any excess ice or snow that may haveaccumulatedontheexterior lights, outside rear view mirrors, windows, vehicle's roof, chassis, around the tires or on the brakes.
- Remove any snow or mud from thebottom of your shoesbefore getting in the vehicle.

## When driving the vehicle

Accelerate the vehicle slowly, keep a safedistancebetweenyou and the vehicle ahead, and drive at a reduced speed suitable to road conditions.

## When parking the vehicle

- Turn automatic mode of the parking brake off. Otherwise, the parking brake may freeze and not be able to be released automatically.

Also, avoid using the following as the parking brake may operate automati- cally, even if automatic mode is off.

- Brake hold system
- ●Park the vehicle and shift the shift lever to P without setting the parking brake. The parking brake may freeze up, preventing it from being released. If the vehicle is parked without setting the parking brake, make sure to block the wheels. Failure to do so may be dangerous because it may cause the vehicle to move unexpectedly, possibly leading to an accident.

When the parking brake is in automatic mode, release the parking brake after shifting the shift lever to P. (→&gt;P.173)

- If thevehicle isparked without setting the parking brake, confirm that the shift lever cannot be moved out of P.
- If the vehicle is left parked with the brakes damp in cold temperatures, there is a possibility of the brakes freezing.

## Scheduled maintenance

- Scheduled maintenance should be performed at specified intervals according to the maintenance schedule.

Theintervalforscheduledmaintenance is determined by the odometer reading orthetimeinterval,whichevercomes first,shownintheschedule.

Maintenance beyond the last period shouldbeperformedatthesameintervals.

- Where to go for maintenance service?

It makes good sense to take your vehicle to your local your Maruti Suzuki authorisedworkshopforthemainte- nanceserviceaswellasotherinspections and repairs.

Maruti Suzuki technicians are welltrained specialists receiving the latest serviceinformationthroughtechnical bulletins, service tips and in-dealership training programs. They learn to work on Maruti Suzuki before they work on your vehicle, rather than while they are working on it. Doesn't that seem like the best way?

YourMarutiSuzukiauthorisedworkshophas invested a lot of money in special Maruti Suzuki tools and service equipment. It helps them to do the job better andatlesscost.

YourMarutiSuzukiauthorisedworkshop'sservicedepartmentwillperform allofthescheduledmaintenanceon your vehicle reliably and economically.

Rubber hoses (for cooling and heater system, brake system and fuel system) should be inspected by a qualified technicianaccordingtotheMarutiSuzuki maintenanceschedule.

Rubber hoses are particularly important maintenanceitems.Haveanydeteriorated or damaged hosesreplaced immediately. Note that rubber hoses will deteriorate with age, resulting in swelling, chafing or cracking.

## Do-it-yourself maintenance

What about do-it-yourself maintenance?

Many of the maintenance items are easytodoyourself ifyouhavealittle mechanical ability and afewbasic automotivetools.

Simple instructionsfor how to perform them arepresented inthissection.

Note,however,thatsomemaintenance tasks require special tools and skills. These are best performed by qualified technicians. Even if you are an experienced do-it-yourself mechanic, we recommendthatrepairsandmaintenance be conducted by your Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop who will keep a recordofmaintenanceonyourvehicle. This record could be helpful should you everrequireWarrantyService.

## Does your vehicle need repairs?

Be on the alert for changes in performanceandsounds,andvisualtip-offs thatindicateserviceisneeded.Some importantcluesare:

- ●Engine missing, stumbling or pinging
- OAppreciable loss of power
- OStrangeenginenoises

## Oil capacity (Drain and refill [Reference*])

| With filter    | 4.2 L (4.4 qt., 3.7 Imp. qt.)   |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Without filter | 3.9 L (4.1 qt., 3.4 Imp. qt.)   |

- *: The engine oil capacity is a reference quantity to be used when changing the engine oil. When actually adding the engine oil, make sure that the oil level is between the low level mark and refill upper limit mark (→P.256). Warm up the engine and turn off the hybrid system, wait about 5 minutes, and check the oil level on the dipstick.

## Engine oil selection

Use the equivalent to satisfy the following grade and viscosity.

Oil grade:

OW-16:

API grade SN "Resource-Conserving", SN PLUS "Resource-Conserving" or SP "Resource-Conserving"; or ILSAC GF-6B multigrade engine oil

OW-20, 5W-20,5W-30 and 10W30:

API grade SL “Energy-Conserving",

SM “Energy-Conserving", SN

"Resource-Conserving", SN PLUS

"Resource-Conserving" or SP

"Resource-Conserving"; or ILSAC GF-6A multigrade engine oil

SAE 0W-16 is filled into your vehicle at manufacturing, and the best choice for good fuel economy and good starting in cold weather.

If you use SAE 10W-30 or a higher viscosityengineoil inextremelylow temperatures, the engine may become difficult to start, so SAE OW-16,0W-20,5W-20 or5W-30 engine oil is recommended.

characteristic of the oil which allows cold startability. Oils with a lowervaluebeforetheWallow for easier starting of the engine in cold weather.

- The 16 in 0W-16 indicates the viscosity characteristic of the oil when the oil is at high temperature. An oil with a higher viscosity (one with a higher value) may be better suited if the vehicle is operated at high speeds, or under extreme load conditions.

How to read oil container labels:

Either or both APl registered marks are added to some oil containers to help you select the oil you should use.

## A API Service Symbol

Top portion:"API SERVICE SP"means theoil qualitydesignationbyAmerican Petroleum Institute (APl).

Center portion: "SAE 0W-16" means the SAE viscosity grade.

Lower portion:"Resource-Conserving" means that the oil has fuel-saving and environmental protection capabilities.
