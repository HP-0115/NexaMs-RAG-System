<!-- image -->

## WARNING

This section describes your Maruti Suzukivehicle'sseatbeltpretensioner system. Read and foliow all these instructions carefully to minimize your risk of severe injury or death.

To determine if your vehicle is equipped with a seat belt pretensioner system at the front or rear seating positions, check the label on the seat belt at thebottompart. If the letter ""p" appears as illustrated, your vehicle is equipped with the seat belt pretensioner system. You can use the preten- sioner seat belts in the same manner as ordinaryseatbelts.

Read this section and "Supplemental Restraint System (Airbags)" section to learn more about the pretensioner system.

The seat belt pretensioner system works with the supplemental restraint system (airbags). The crash sensors and the electronic controller of the airbag system also control the seat belt pretensioners. The pretensioners are triggered only when thereisafrontalorsidecollisionsevere enoughtotrigger the airbags and theseat belts arefastened.For precautions and general information including servicing the pretensioner system,refer to"Supplemental Restraint System (Airbags)" section in addition tothis"Seat Belt Pretensioner system" section, and follow all those precautions.

The pretensioner is located in each front seatbeltretractor.Thepretensioner tightens the seat belt so the belt fits the occupant's body more snugly in the event of a frontal or side collision.The retractors will remain locked after the pretensioners are activated. Upon activation, some noise will occur and some smoke maybe released. These conditions are not harmful and do not indicate a fire in the vehicle.

The driver and all passengers must be properly restrained by fastening seat belts at all times, whether or not a pretensioner is equipped at their seating position, to

## Seat Belt Force Limiter System (Only for Front Seat)

69RHS167

<!-- image -->

In the event of a strong impact coming fromthe front,the seat belt force limiter operates in two stages (driver's seat) and one stage (front passenger's seat) to reduce a force to the shoulder strap, thus lessening the impact being sustained by the front passengers.

55T020340

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

If the seat belt sustains strong impact, the resin of the shoulder anchor part (1) and the tongue plate part (2)couid soften due to heavy friction, thus sticking to the seat belt, making the belt slide less easily. In such a case, the seat belt may not provide the best performance, resulting in severe injury in case of emergency. Have the seat belt replaced by Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

68KM090

Side airbags and side curtain airbags are designed to inflate in severe side impact collisions when the ignition mode is ON.

Side airbags and side curtain airbags are not designed to inflate in frontal or rear collisions, rollovers or minor side collisions, since they would offer no protection in those types of accidents. Only the side airbag and side curtain airbag on the side of the vehicle that is struck will inflate. However, in a frontal angle collision, the side airbags and side curtain airbags may inflate.Since an airbag deploys only one time during an accident, seat belts are needed to restrain occupants from further movements during the accident.

Therefore, an airbag is not a substitute for seat belts. To maximize your protection, always fasten your seat belts. Be aware that no system can prevent all possible injuries that may occur in an accident.

## Page 94
## Function of Airbags

## How the SystemWorks

In a frontal collision, the collision sensors willdetectrapiddeceleration,and if the controller judges that the deceleration represents a severe frontal collision, the controller will trigger the inflators. The inflators inflate the appropriate airbags with nitrogen or argon gas. The inflated airbags provide a cushion for your head and upper body. The airbag inflates and deflates so quickly that you may not even realize that it has activated. The airbag will neither hinder your view nor make it harder to exit the vehicle.

A seat belt helps keep you in the proper position for maximum protection when an airbag inflates. Adjust your seat as far back as possible while still maintaining control of the vehicle. Sit fully back in your seat; sit up straight;do not lean over the steering wheel or dashboard. Front occupants should not lean on or sleep against the door.Refer to"Seat Adjustment"section and"Seat Belts and Child Restraint Systems" section in this section for details on proper seat and seat belt adjustments.

## WARNING

- Thedrivershouldnotleanoverthe steering wheel. The front passenger should not rest his or her body against the dashboard where a front air bag is mounted or a child should not stand in front of the dashboard.Otherwise,he or she willgettooclosetothedashboard. For vehicles with side air bags and side curtain air bag, occupants should not lean on or sleep against the door. In these situations, the out-of-position occupant would be too close to an inflating airbag, and may suffer severe injury.

## Servicing the airbag system

If the airbags inflate, have the airbags and relatedcomponentsreplacedbyMaruti Suzukiauthorisedworkshopassoonas possible.

If your vehicle ever gets in deep water and the driver's floor is submerged, the airbag controller could be damaged. If this happens, ask Maruti Suzuki authorised workshoptochecktheairbagsystemassoon as possible.

Special procedures are required for servicing or replacing an airbag. For that reason, only Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop shouldbeallowedtoserviceorreplace your airbags. Remind anyone who servicesyourMarutiSuzukivehiclethatithas airbags.

To prevent damage or unintended inflation of the airbag system, check that the batteryisdisconnectedandtheignitionswitch has been in"LOCK" position or the ignition mode has been in LOCK(OFF) for atleast 90 seconds before performing any electrical service work on your Maruti Suzuki vehicle. Do not touch airbag system components or wires. The wires are wrapped withyellow tape or yellow tubing, and the couplers are yellow for easy identification.

Service on or around airbag components or wiring must beperformed onlybyMaruti Suzuki authorised  workshop. Improper service could result in unintended airbag deployment or could render the airbag inoperative. Either of these two conditions may result in severe injury.

## Pinching Prevention Function

The driver's window is equipped with a pinching prevention function. This function detects a foreign object that is caught in the window as it is being closed by AUTOUP feature, which allows you to close the window without holding the window switch in UP position, and stops the window from closing to prevent damage.

WARNING

Thefunctionmaynotdetect the object depending on shape, size, hardnessandpositionoftheobject caught by the closing window. This may cause severe injury. Be verycareful when opening or closing the windows.

## A CAUTION

- The pinching prevention function does not operate while you are holding the window switch in UP position.
- The pinching prevention function may not detect an object caught in thewindowjustbefore thewindow is fully closed.

## NOTE:

Even if you cannot close thewindowby the AUTO-uPfeaturebecause there maybe somethingwrong withthepinchingprevention function,you can close the window by holding the window switch in UP position. If youdrive inextreme off-roadcondition, thepinchingpreventionfunctionmayoperateaccidentallybecausethewindow reacts to vehicle jolting.

## Pinching prevention function initialization

When you disconnect and reconnect the lead-acid battery or replace the fuse, the function will be deactivated. In this condition, the AUTO-DOWN feature will be deactivated，whiletheAUTO-UPfeature may remain activated. The pinching prevention function needs to be initialized.

- (1) Symbol representing an obstacle detected by parking sensor*

* This symbol shows that an obstacle is located on the right rear of vehicle.

- The parking sensor system uses ultrasonic sensors todetect obstacles near the rear bumper. If obstacles are sensed while you are parking or moving the vehicle slowly, the system warns you by sounding a buzzer and displaying symbols representing the obstacles on the information display  in the  instrument cluster.
- ·The system emits an ultrasonic wave and  t therelevantsensordetectsthe return of thewavereflectedby anobstacle.The systemmeasures the time takenbytheultrasonicwavetoreachthe obstacle and return from it, from which it determines the obstacle's position.
- Theparking sensorfunction canbeused when you turn the ignition switch to "ON" position or the engine switch is pressed to change the ignition mode to "ON", the gearshift lever is in the "R" position. This function is helpful in the following cases: pulling over to the curb; parallel-parking the vehicle; steering the vehicle into a garage; driving along an alley; and moving slowly in a place with obstacles.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

- The parking sensor warns you of obstacles with buzzers andby showing you the location of the obstacles ontheinformationdisplay. However, you must still pay full' attention yourself while driving.
- Thesensorscandetectobstacles only within a limited area and only when the vehicle is moving within a limited speed range. So, in tricky areas, you must move the vehicle slowly while checking around it using your direct vision or rearview mirrors.There isincreased risk of an accident if you control the vehicle relying only on the parking sensor.

## NOTICE

Parking sensors are only for driver's assistance.

## NOTE:

When thegearshiftlever is shifted to the "R" position, a buzzer will sound once.

## Electronic Stability Program (ESP?) (if equipped)

ESP®  is \_a registered   trademark of Mercedes-BenzGroupAG.

The Electronic Stability Program (ESP?) helps to control the vehicle during cornering if front wheels or rear wheels skid.It also assists you in maintaining traction while accelerating on loose or slippery road surfaces. It does this by regulating the engine's output, and by selectively applying the brakes. In addition, ESP? heips to avoid skidding by controlling braking pressure.

## WARNING

The ESP? cannot enhance the vehicle'sdrivingstabilityinallsituations anddoesnotcontrolyourvehicle's entire braking system. The ESp? cannotprevent taccidents, including thoseresultingfromexcessivespeed in turns, or hydroplaning. Only safe and attentive drive can prevent accidents.

The capabilities of an ESp-equipped vehicle must never be used as a substitute for careful driving.
---

## Page 280
The ESP? has the following systems:

## Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)

Refer to"Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)"in this section.

## Brake Assist System

Refer to "Brake Assist System" in this section.

## Traction Control System

The traction control system automatically helps prevent the spinning of wheels when thevehicleisstartedoracceleratedon slippery road surfaces. The system operates only if itsensesthat some of the wheels are spinning or beginning to lose traction. When this happens, the system operates the front or rear brakes and reduces engine power to limit wheel spin.

## Stability Control System

The vehicle stability control system helps provide integrated control of systems such as anti-lock brakes, traction control, engine control, etc. This system automatically controls the brakes and engine to help prevent thevehicle from skiddingwhencornering on a slippery road surface or when turning the steering wheel abruptly.

<!-- image -->

The distance needed to bring any vehicle toahaltincreaseswiththespeedof the vehicle.The braking distance needed,for example,at60km/hwillbeapproximately 4 times greater than the braking distance neededat30km/h.Start todepress the brake pedal when there is plenty of distance between your vehicle and the stopping point, and slow down gradually.

## NOTE:

While braking you may hear operational noisedue tofrictionbetweenbrake disc/ drumandbrakelining.Thisisanormal phenomenon and does not indicate any abnormalityoraffectnormalfunctioningof thevehicle.

## WARNING

If water gets into the brake devices, brake performance may become poor and unpredictable.  After driving throughwaterorwashingtheundersideof thevehicle,test thebrakes while driving at a slow speed to see if they have maintained their normal effectiveness.If thebrakesareless effective than normal, dry them by repeatedly applying the brakes while driving slowly until the brakes have regained their normal effectiveness.

## Power-assisted Brakes

Your vehicle has power-assisted brakes. If power assistance is lost due to a stalled engine or other failures, the system is stil fully operational onreserve power and you can bring the vehicle to a complete stop by pressing the brake pedal once and holding it down. The reserve power is partly used up when you depress the brake pedal and reduces each time the pedal is pressed. Apply smooth and even pressure to the pedal. Do not pump the pedal.
---

## Page 285
## WARNING

Evenwithoutreservepowerinthe brake system, you can still stop the vehicle by pressing the brake pedal harder than normallyrequired.However, the stopping distance may be longer.

## BrakeAssist System

When you slam the brakes on, the brake assistsystemdeterminesittobeanemerbraking for adriverwhocannothold down the brake pedal firmly.

## NOTE:

Ifyou quickly and forcefully depress the brakes, you may hear clicking sound by the brake assist system operation. This is normalandindicatesthatthebrakeassist systemisactivatedproperly.

## Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)

ABS will help you avoid skidding by electronically controlling braking pressure. It will also help you maintain steering control when braking on slippery surfaces or when braking hard.

The ABS works automatically, so you do not need any special braking technique. Justpushthebrakepedaldownwithout pumping. The ABS will operate whenever it senses that the wheels are locking up. You may feel the brake pedal move a little while the ABS is operating.

## WARNING

- Always check the surrounding conditions anddrive thevehicleina safe manner, as controlling the vehiclebyABShaslimitsandthe system may not function properly depending on the surrounding conditions.
- If tyre grip performance is over the limit or hydroplaning occurs, ABS cannot work properly.

## NOTE:

- ·IftheABSsystemisactivated,youmay hear a clunking noise and/or feel pulsatinginthebrakepedal.Thisisnormal and indicates that the brake fluid pressure is being controlled properly.
- ·You may hear an operation sound when youstarttheengineorafterthevehicle begins to move. This means that the

abovesystemsareintheself-check mode. This sound does not indicate a malfunction.

## Braking Distance

ABS is not designed to shorten the stopping distance.

## WARNING

- In the following situations, the braking distance required for a vehicle withABSmaybe slightly greater than the one required for a vehiclewithoutABS,resultinginan accident. Drive the vehicle slowly and    maintain    ample   distance between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you.
- When driving on rough roads such as unpaved or stone-paved roads
- When driving on gravel roads or fresh snow roads
- Whendrivingoverbumpsonthe roadssuchasjointseams

## Page 286
## NOTE:

- ·When applying sudden brake or applying brake onslipperyroads,thebraking distancerequiredforavehiclewithABS is almost the same as the one required foravehiclewithoutABS.
- Ifyouwouldliketosuddenlyapply brake, just push the brake pedal down firmly without pumping. Otherwise, the longer braking distance will be required.
- ：TheABSwillnotworkifvehiclespeedis under about 9 km/h. This depends on theroadconditions.

## Vibration and Sound during ABS Operation

When strongly depressing the brake pedal, you might feel vibration of the brake pedal, the steering wheel, and the vehicle body. Thisis due toABSoperation,and doesnotindicate a malfunction;continue strongly depressing the brake pedal at this time.

## NOTE:

Immediately after starting the engine and beginning to drive, you might temporarily hearamotorsound.Thismeansthatthe systems are in self-check mode.This sounddoesnotindicateamalfunction.

## Tyres

## WARNING

ABS detects each wheelrotation speed via a sensor. If tyres or wheels other than those specifiedinthe owner's manual are used for size, type, tread pattern, or if worn conditions of tyres are different, the correctwheelrotationspeedcannotbe detected and ABS will not work properly. This may result in an accident. When replacing tyres, use the tyres with the size, type, and tread patterns which are specified in this owner's manual.

Also, do not use the tyres which are excessively worn.

69RHS180

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

<!-- image -->

Donotputthegearshiftleverintothe "N" (Neutral) position while driving, except in times of emergency, as this disengages engine braking, which could result in an accident.

## NOTE:

Non-usage of vehicle for long duration may cause gradual rustingonbrakedisc surface as it is made of cast iron. This may resultinnoise/vibration.Thesamehasno bearing on functioning of the vehicle. Regulardrivingofvehiclemayprevent/remove rust,thusreducingthenoiseandvibration.

## What Should You Do in Case of Malfunction or Emergency?

- Warning light turns on

Stop immediately in a safe place and take corrective action.

For details, refer to "Warning Lights and Indicators" in the "QUICK GUIDE" section or "Warning and indicator messages" in the "INSTRUMENT CLUSTER".

- You feel strong shock from under the floor

Immediately stop in a safe place and checkwhetherthereisbrakefluidleakage or fuel leakage, and also check whether there is any abnormality in the exhaust pipe, etc. If any abnormality is found, consult with a Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

- Sudden tyre puncture

Grasp the steering wheel firmly, carefully apply the brake, slowly reduce speed, and stop in a safe place.

- ·You feel that the brake pedal is heavy to use

Via engine vacuum pressure, the vehicle utilizes a brake booster to reduce the force necessary for depressing the brake pedal. If this engine vacuum pressure decreases, you may feel as if the brakes require more force than usual to depress, but this is not abnormal. Depress the brake pedal as strongly as you need to.

- Metallic screeching sound is heard from thebrakes

Promptly consult with a Maruti Suzuki authorisedworkshop.Thediskbrake pads(Maruti Suzukigenuineparts）are designed to emit a creaking/screeching sound as a functiontowarn thewear, as they have almost reached usage limit and replacement timing.

## WARNING

The brakes could belosing their ability to function normally, which could result in an accident. If you hear a metallic creaking/ screeching sound, do not continue driving.

## Page 293
## Use Engine Brake on a Long Downhill Slope

Use engine braking(*) in tandem with regular braking when driving on a long downhill slope. Release the accelerator pedal and shift down according to vehicle speed, releasetheacceleratorpedalandshift down according to vehicle speed.

## Manual transmission vehicles

55T060010

<!-- image -->

For manual transmission vehicle, shift down to a lower gear one by one.

## AutoGearShiftvehicles

55T060020

<!-- image -->

For AutoGear Shift vehicle,shift the gearshift lever into "M" (manual mode) first. Then, pull "" side of the shift paddle to shift down to an appropriate gear position.

- *: Engine braking is a braking effect that occurs when you release your foot from the accelerator pedal while driving.The lower the gear, the greater the effect of engine braking becomes.

<!-- image -->

## WARNING

Continuously depressing the brake pedal could cause the brakes to overheat, possibly rendering them ineffective.

## When Side Wind Is Strong

72J20330

<!-- image -->

At a tunnel exit, on a bridge, or when a large truck passes you, your vehicle might be blown slightly sideways by side wind. Do not panic. Firmly grasp the steering wheel, gradually reduce speed, and regain your intended course.

## Page 294
## Drive Slowly on a Slippery Road Surface

59RN06030

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

<!-- image -->

When driving on wet, icy, or snowy roads, etc., refrain from sudden movements, such as sudden starting, acceleration, braking, turning or abrupt engine braking. Otherwise, there is the danger of an accident due to loss of traction.

## Do not Drive on Puddles at High Speed

69RHS182

<!-- image -->

## CAUTION

<!-- image -->

When driving on puddles or on wet road surfaces at high speed, a thin surfaceofwaterisbuiltbetweenthe wheels and the road surface, and the wheels may float. This is called as hydroplaning, which leads to a loss of control in the steering wheel and the brakes and possibly results in an accident.

## Check Brake Effectiveness after Driving on Puddles or Washing a Vehicle

72J20360

<!-- image -->

- After verifying the safety of the surroundings, depress the brake pedal several times at lowspeedandcheck thebrake effectiveness.
- ·If the brake effectiveness is still poor, depress the brake pedal at low speed gently and repeatedly until the brake effectiveness is fully recovered, to dry the brake equipment.

## Page 295
## When Encountering a Flooded Area

61M0075

<!-- image -->

Avoid driving in a flooded area or a deep puddle. If driving in a flooded area is unavoidable, go slowly in the lowest gear. In case that you have driven in a flooded area,stop the vehicle in a safe and non flooded place while checking the brake effectiveness.Then，askMarutiSuzuki authorised workshop to check the following inspection items.

- ·Functionofbrake
- Function of electrical components
- Changes of oil level and quality for engine, transmission and differential.In case that the oil is turbid whitely, water has been mixed in the oiland an oil change is required.
- Lubricant condition of the bearings, suspension joints, etc.

## NOTICE

Avoid driving in a flooded area or a deeppuddle.Itmaycauseanengine stall, short in electrical components, engine and transmission damages, etc.

## Highway Driving

- Stopping distance progressively increases with vehicle speed. Apply the brakes far enough ahead of the stopping point to allow for the extra stopping distance.

When driving at highway speeds, pay attention to the following:

- On rainy days, hydroplaning can occur. Hydroplaning is the loss of direct contact betweentheroadsurfaceandthevehicle's tyres due to a water film forming between them. Steering or braking the vehicle during hydroplaning can be very difficult, and loss of control can occur. Keep speed down when the road surface is wet.
- ·At high speeds, the vehicle may be affected by side winds. Therefore, reducespeedandbepreparedforunexpected buffeting, which can occur at the exits of tunnels, when passing by a cut of a hill, or when being overtaken by large vehicles, etc.

## ADVICEFORYOURDRIVING

## Driving on Hills Manual transmission vehicles

55T060010

<!-- image -->

## Auto GearShiftvehicles

55T060020

<!-- image -->

- When driving on steep hills, the vehicle may begin to slow down and show a lack of power. If this happens, you should shift to a lower gear so that the engine willagain be operating in its higher power range. Shift rapidly to prevent the vehicle from losing momentum.
- ·When driving down a hill, the engine should be used for braking by shifting to the next lower gear.

## WARNING

Do not hold the brake pedal down too long or too often while going down a steep or long hill. This could cause the brakes to overheat,resulting in reduced braking efficiency. Failure to take this precaution could result in lossofvehiclecontrol.

## NOTICE

When descending a downhill, Never turn the ignition key to "LocK" position or press the engine switch to change the ignition mode to LoCK (OFF). Emission control system damage may result.

## Off-road Driving Do not Drive in the Field Covered with Grown Grass

69RHS181

<!-- image -->

Do not drive inthe field covered with grown grass If you drive in the field covered with grass, it may cause accident or fire or vehicle damage by getting caught in grown grass.

## WARNING

If loose grass, etc. becomes entangled in drive train parts or exhaust pipes, drive train components might become damaged or fire may result.

## Improving Fuel Economy

## NOTE:

Fuel economy(mileage) of the vehicle may vary due to several factors i.e. driving habits-gearchangepattern,usageofA.C,Air pressure in the tyres, wind speed, traffic conditions,fuel quality-non adulterated standard fuel, maintenance of vehicle, roadconditions,brakingetc.

The following instructions will help you improve fuel economy.

## Keep Tyre Pressures Correct

Under-inflation of the tyres can waste fuel due to increased running resistance of the tyres. Keep your tyres inflated to the correct pressure shown on the label on the driver'ssidedoororthedriver'sdoorlock pillar.

## Keep Weight to a Minimum

The heavier the load is, the more fuel the vehicle consumes. Unload any unnecessary luggage or cargo.

## Avoid Excessive idling

If you park your vehicle for more than one minute,stop the engine and start it again later. When warming up a cold engine, do not allow the engine to idle or apply full throttle until the engine has reached operating temperature. Allow the engine to warm up by driving.

## Avoid Fast Starts, Rapid Acceleration and Hard Braking

## Avoidfaststarts

Fast starts away from lights or stop signs willconsumefuelunnecessarily and shorten engine life. Start off slowly.

## Avoid unnecessary stops

Avoid unnecessary deceleration and stopping. Try to maintain a moderate, steady speed whenever possible. Slowing down and thenaccelerating again uses more fuel.

## Keep a steady cruising speed

Drive at a constant speed that road and traffic conditions will permit.

## Page 298
## Do not Race the Engine

69RHS060

<!-- image -->

Revving the engine only consumes extra fuel and has no benefit.

## NOTICE

Immediately after starting, the engine is often not yet fully warmed up. Therefore, revving the engine, starting to drive suddenly, or rapid acceleration can cause engine failure.

## Drive with an Appropriate Gear for VehicleSpeed

Running the vehicle at a high engine rotation speed by using a low-speed gear will result in poor fuel economy. Use the correct gear according to the vehicle speed.

## Keep the Air Cleaner Clean

59RN06050

<!-- image -->

If the air cleaner is clogged with dust, there will be greater intake resistance, resulting indecreasedpoweroutputandincreased fuel consumption.

## StuckVehicle

If your vehicle gets stuck in snow, mud or sand, follow the directions below:

- 1） Shift the transmission back and forth between a forward range (or first gear formanual transmission)andreverse. This will create a rocking motion which may give you enoughmomentum to free the vehicle.Press gently on the acceleratortokeepwheelspinningtoa minimum wheel rpm. Remove your foot from the accelerator while shifting. Do notrace the engine.Excessivewheel spin will cause the tyres to dig deeper, making it more difficult to free the vehi-

cle.

## NOTE:

You may have to turn the ESP system (if equipped)off in order to allow spinning the wheels.

- 2) If your vehicle remains stuck after a few minutes of rocking, we recommend you toconsultaMarutiSuzukiauthorised workshopor aroadsideassistanceservice. If a towing service is not available in an emergency, your vehicle may be temporarilytowedby a towingcable or chain secured to the towing eye either on the front or rear of the vehicle.Refer to "Towing by Using Towing Eye"in the "EMERGENCYSERVICE"section.

## Catalytic Converter

80G106

<!-- image -->

The purpose of the catalytic converter is to minimize theamountofharmfulpollutants inyour vehicle's exhaust.Use of leaded fuel in vehicles equipped with catalytic converters is prohibited,because lead deactivates the pollutant-reducing components of the catalyst system.

The converter is designed to last the life of thevehicleundernormalusageandwhen unleaded fuel is used. No special maintenance is required on the converter. However, it is very important to keep the engine properly tuned. Engine misfiring, which can result from an improperly tuned engine maycause overheating of the catalytic converter. This may result in permanent heat damage tothecatalyticconverter and othervehicle components.

## NOTICE

Tominimize the possibility of catalytic converter or other vehicle damage:

- Maintain the engine in the proper operating condition.
- In the event of an engine malfunction, particularly one involving engine misfire or other apparent loss of performance, have the vehicle serviced promptly.
- Do not try to start the engine by pushing or towing the vehicle, or coasting down a hill.
- ·Donot turnofftheengineorinterrupt the ignition when the transmission is in gear and the vehicle is in motion.
- Do not idle the engine with any spark plug wires disconnected or removed, such as during diagnostic testing.
- Do not allow the fuel tank to get nearthe emptylevel.
- Do not idle the vehicle for prolonged periods if idling seems rough or there are other malfunctions.

## Maintenance

If you do not use the air conditioner for a long period, such as during winter, it may not give the best performance when you start using it again. To help maintain optimum performance and durability of your air conditioner, it needs tobe run periodically. Operate the air conditioner at least once a month for one minute with the engine idling. This circulates the refrigerant and oil and helps protect the internal components.

Your air conditioner is equipped with air filters.Cleanorreplace themasspecifiedin "Maintenance Schedule"in the"INSPECTIONANDMAINTENANCE"section.Have this job done by a Maruti Suzuki authorisedworkshopasthelowerglovebox must be lowered for this job.

## NOTE:

Your vehicle uses the air conditioning refrigerantHFC-134a,commonlycalled R-134a.R-134areplacedR-12 around 1993 for automotive applications. Other refrigerants are available, including recycled R-12,butonly R-134a should be used inyourvehicle.

## NOTICE

Using the wrong refrigerant may damage your air conditioning system.Use R-134a only. Do not mix or replace the R-134a with other refrigerants.

## VEHICLELOADINGANDTOWING

## Vehicle Loading

Your vehicle was designed for specific weight capacities.Theweight capacities of yourvehicleareindicatedbytheGross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) and the Permissible maximum Axle Weight (PAW, front and rear). The GVWR and PAW (front and rear）are listed in the "SPECIFICATIONS"section.

GVWR - Maximum permissible overall weight of the fully loaded vehicle (including all the occupants, accessories and cargo plus the trailer nose weight if towing a trailer).

PAW - (Front and Rear) Maximum permissible weight on an individual axle.

Actual weight of the loaded vehicle and actualloads atthefront andrear axlescan only be determined by weighing the vehicle.Compare theseweights to theGVWR and PAW (front and rear). If the gross vehicleweightor theloadoneither axle exceeds these ratings, you must remove enough weight to bring the load down to the rated capacity.

## WARNING

- Never overload your vehicle. The gross vehicle weight (sum of the weightsofthevehicle,alltheoccupants, accessories, cargo plus trailer nose weight if towing a trailer) must never exceedthe Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). In addition, never distributealoadsothattheweighton eitherthefrontorrearaxleexceeds thePermissiblemaximumAxle Weight (PAW).
- Always distribute cargo evenly. To avoid personal injury or damage to your vehicle, always secure cargo toprevent it from shifting if the vehiclemovessuddenly.Place heavier objects on the floor and as far forward in the cargo area as possible. Never pile cargo higher than the top of the seat backs.

## Trailer Towing

To avoid uneven wear of your tyres and to prolong their life, rotate the tyres as illustrated. Tyres should be rotated every 100o0 km. After rotation, adjust front and rear tyre pressures to the specification listed on your vehicle's Tyre information Label.

## NOTE:

Donot use aspare tyrefor tyre rotation if thesize,brand,treadpatternorwheelsof the spare tyre differ from those of the other fourwheels.

## WheelBalancing

If  the vehicle vibrates abnormally on smooth road, have the wheel balanced at a Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

## WheelAlignment

In case of abnormal tyre wear or pulling towards one side, have the wheel aligned at a Maruti Suzuki authorised workshop.

## TubelessTyres

The vehicle is equipped with Tubeless Tyres. In tubeless tyre, a thin layer of butyl rubber is used for lining the inside of the tubeless tyre. This layer is to prevent air loss and fulfilling the purpose of tube. The air pressure is maintained by the sealing between tyre bead and wheel rim. Tubeless tyres are having advantage of slow air loss and preventing sudden deflation while driving.

## Care and maintenance tips for tubeless tyres

- 2) In case any leakage is found, check for any nail penetration/valve core damage or rim bent. Damaged wheel must not be used.
- 1) Always maintain recommended inflation pressure. Driving continuously at low inflation pressure can lead to tyre damage.
- 3) In case tyre has run at low pressure, it must be inspected for any defect.
- 4) Whenever new tyre is fitted, replace the valve.
